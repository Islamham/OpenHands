If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

Some advanced statistical functionality requires [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and/or [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/).\n    32\t\n    33\t\n    34\tInstallation\n    35\t------------\n    36\t\n    37\tThe latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from PyPI:\n    38\t\n    39\t    pip install seaborn\n    40\t\n    41\tIt is also possible to include optional statistical dependencies:\n    42\t\n    43\t    pip install seaborn[stats]\n    44\t\n    45\tSeaborn can also be installed with conda:\n    46\t\n    47\t    conda install seaborn\n    48\t\n    49\tNote that the main anaconda repository lags PyPI in adding new releases, but conda-forge (`-c conda-forge`) typically updates quickly.\n    50\t\n    51\tCiting\n    52\t------\n    53\t\n    54\tA paper describing seaborn has been published in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03021). The paper provides an introduction to the key features of the library, and it can be used as a citation if seaborn proves integral to a scientific publication.\n    55\t\n    56\tTesting\n    57\t-------\n    58\t\n    59\tTesting seaborn requires installing additional dependencies; they can be installed with the `dev` extra (e.g., `pip install .[dev]`).\n    60\t\n    61\tTo test the code, run `make test` in the source directory. This will exercise the unit tests (using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)) and generate a coverage report.\n    62\t\n    63\tCode style is enforced with `flake8` using the settings in the [`setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg) file. Run `make lint` to check. Alternately, you can use `pre-commit` to automatically run lint checks on any files you are committing: just run `pre-commit install` to set it up, and then commit as usual going forward.\n    64\t\n    65\tDevelopment\n    66\t-----------\n    67\t\n    68\tSeaborn development takes place on Github: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn\n    69\t\n    70\tPlease submit bugs that you encounter to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues) with a reproducible example demonstrating the problem.

Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>","tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"execute_bash","description":"Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

As a pure Python package,\n    13\t*pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working\n    14\twith *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](https://numpy.org).\n    15\t\n    16\tNote that *pydicom* is a general-purpose DICOM framework concerned with\n    17\treading and writing DICOM datasets. In order to keep the\n    18\tproject manageable, it does not handle the specifics of individual SOP classes\n    19\tor other aspects of DICOM. Other libraries both inside and outside the\n    20\t[pydicom organization](https://github.com/pydicom) are based on *pydicom*\n    21\tand provide support for other aspects of DICOM, and for more\n    22\tspecific applications.\n    23\t\n    24\tExamples are [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom), which\n    25\tis a Python library for DICOM networking, and [deid](https://github.com/pydicom/deid),\n    26\twhich supports the anonymization of DICOM files.\n    27\t\n    28\t\n    29\t## Installation\n    30\t\n    31\tUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n    32\t```\n    33\tpip install pydicom\n    34\t```\n    35\tUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n    36\t```\n    37\tconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n    38\t```\n    39\t\n    40\tFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n    41\t\n    42\t\n    43\t## Documentation\n    44\t\n    45\tThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/guides/user/index.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n    46\t\n    47\t## *Pixel Data*\n    48\t\n    49\tCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\n    50\tbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n    51\t```python\n    52\t>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n    53\t>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n    54\t>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n    55\t>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n    56\t>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n    57\t<class 'bytes'>\n    58\t>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n    59\t32768\n    60\t>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\n    61\tb'\\xaf\\x00'\n    62\t\n    63\t```\n    64\t\n    65\tIf [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n    66\t\n    67\t```python\n    68\t>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n    69\t>>> arr.shape\n    70\t(128, 128)\n    71\t>>> arr\n    72\tarray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n    73\t       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n    74\t       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n    75\t       ...,\n    76\t       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n    77\t       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n    78\t       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n    79\t```\n    80\t### Decompressing *Pixel Data*\n    81\t#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\n    82\tConverting JPEG, JPEG-LS or JPEG 2000 compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/guides/user/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n    83\t\n    84\t#### RLE\n    85\tDecompressing RLE *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, however it can be quite slow. You may want to consider [installing one or more additional Python libraries](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/guides/user/image_data_compression.html) to speed up the process.\n    86\t\n    87\t### Compressing *Pixel Data*\n    88\tInformation on compressing *Pixel Data* using one of the below formats can be found in the corresponding [encoding guides](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/guides/encoding/index.html). These guides cover the specific requirements for each encoding method and we recommend you be familiar with them when performing image compression.\n    89\t\n    90\t#### JPEG-LS, JPEG 2000\n    91\tCompressing image data from an ``ndarray`` or ``bytes`` object to JPEG-LS or JPEG 2000 requires installing the following:\n    92\t\n    93\t* JPEG-LS requires [pyjpegls](https://github.com/pydicom/pyjpegls)\n    94\t* JPEG 2000 requires [pylibjpeg](https://github.com/pydicom/pylibjpeg) and the [pylibjpeg-openjpeg](https://github.com/pydicom/pylibjpeg-openjpeg) plugin\n    95\t\n    96\t#### RLE\n    97\tCompressing using RLE requires no additional packages but can be quite slow. It can be sped up by installing [pylibjpeg](https://github.com/pydicom/pylibjpeg) with the [pylibjpeg-rle](https://github.com/pydicom/pylibjpeg-rle) plugin, or [gdcm](https://github.com/tfmoraes/python-gdcm).\n    98\t\n    99\t\n   100\t## Examples\n   101\tMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n   102\t\n   103\t**Change a patient's ID**\n   104\t```python\n   105\tfrom pydicom import dcmread\n   106\t\n   107\tds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n   108\t# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\n   109\tds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\n   110\tds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n   111\t```\n   112\t\n   113\t**Display the Pixel Data**\n   114\t\n   115\tWith [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n   116\t```python\n   117\timport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   118\tfrom pydicom import dcmread, examples\n   119\t\n   120\t# The path to the example \"ct\" dataset included with pydicom\n   121\tpath: \"pathlib.Path\" = examples.get_path(\"ct\")\n   122\tds = dcmread(path)\n   123\t# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\n   124\tarr = ds.pixel_array\n   125\t\n   126\tplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\n   127\tplt.show()\n   128\t```\n   129\t\n   130\t## Contributing\n   131\t\n   132\tWe are all volunteers working on *pydicom* in our free time.

For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished.

TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>","tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"execute_bash","description":"Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

Unfortunately, the way Apple currently installs its own copies\n   216\tof NumPy, Scipy and Matplotlib means that these packages are difficult to\n   217\tupgrade (see `system python packages`_).  For that reason we strongly suggest\n   218\tthat you install a fresh version of Python and use that as the basis for\n   219\tinstalling libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib.  One convenient way to\n   220\tinstall Matplotlib with other useful Python software is to use the Anaconda_\n   221\tPython scientific software collection, which includes Python itself and a\n   222\twide range of libraries; if you need a library that is not available from the\n   223\tcollection, you can install it yourself using standard methods such as *pip*.\n   224\tSee the Anaconda web page for installation support.\n   225\t\n   226\t.. _system python packages:\n   227\t    https://github.com/MacPython/wiki/wiki/Which-Python#system-python-and-extra-python-packages\n   228\t.. _Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/\n   229\t\n   230\tOther options for a fresh Python install are the standard installer from\n   231\t`python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/>`_, or installing\n   232\tPython using a general macOS package management system such as `homebrew\n   233\t<https://brew.sh/>`_ or `macports <https://www.macports.org>`_.  Power users on\n   234\tmacOS will likely want one of homebrew or macports on their system to install\n   235\topen source software packages, but it is perfectly possible to use these\n   236\tsystems with another source for your Python binary, such as Anaconda\n   237\tor Python.org Python.\n   238\t\n   239\t.. _install_macos_binaries:\n   240\t\n   241\tInstalling macOS binary wheels\n   242\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n   243\t\n   244\tIf you are using Python from https://www.python.org, Homebrew, or Macports,\n   245\tthen you can use the standard pip installer to install Matplotlib binaries in\n   246\tthe form of wheels.\n   247\t\n   248\tpip is installed by default with python.org and Homebrew Python, but needs to\n   249\tbe manually installed on Macports with ::\n   250\t\n   251\t   sudo port install py38-pip\n   252\t\n   253\tOnce pip is installed, you can install Matplotlib and all its dependencies with\n   254\tfrom the Terminal.app command line::\n   255\t\n   256\t   python3 -m pip install matplotlib\n   257\t\n   258\tYou might also want to install IPython or the Jupyter notebook (``python3 -m pip\n   259\tinstall ipython notebook``).\n   260\t\n   261\tChecking your installation\n   262\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n   263\t\n   264\tThe new version of Matplotlib should now be on your Python \"path\".  Check this\n   265\tat the Terminal.app command line::\n   266\t\n   267\t  python3 -c 'import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.__version__, matplotlib.__file__)'\n   268\t\n   269\tYou should see something like ::\n   270\t\n   271\t  3.10.0 /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/__init__.py\n   272\t\n   273\twhere ``3.10.0`` is the Matplotlib version you just installed, and the path\n   274\tfollowing depends on whether you are using Python.org Python, Homebrew or\n   275\tMacports.  If you see another version, or you get an error like ::\n   276\t\n   277\t    Traceback (most recent call last):\n   278\t      File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\n   279\t    ImportError: No module named matplotlib\n   280\t\n   281\tthen check that the Python binary is the one you expected by running ::\n   282\t\n   283\t  which python3\n   284\t\n   285\tIf you get a result like ``/usr/bin/python...``, then you are getting the\n   286\tPython installed with macOS, which is probably not what you want.  Try closing\n   287\tand restarting Terminal.app before running the check again. If that doesn't fix\n   288\tthe problem, depending on which Python you wanted to use, consider reinstalling\n   289\tPython.org Python, or check your homebrew or macports setup.  Remember that\n   290\tthe disk image installer only works for Python.org Python, and will not get\n   291\tpicked up by other Pythons.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

The package includes a large and growing library\n    24\tof domain-agnostic functions for advanced analytics and visualization\n    25\twith these data structures.\n    26\t\n    27\tXarray was inspired by and borrows heavily from\n    28\t[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), the popular data analysis package\n    29\tfocused on labelled tabular data. It is particularly tailored to working\n    30\twith [netCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf) files, which\n    31\twere the source of xarray\\'s data model, and integrates tightly with\n    32\t[dask](https://dask.org) for parallel computing.\n    33\t\n    34\t## Why xarray?\n    35\t\n    36\tMulti-dimensional (a.k.a. N-dimensional, ND) arrays (sometimes called\n    37\t\"tensors\") are an essential part of computational science. They are\n    38\tencountered in a wide range of fields, including physics, astronomy,\n    39\tgeoscience, bioinformatics, engineering, finance, and deep learning. In\n    40\tPython, [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org) provides the fundamental data\n    41\tstructure and API for working with raw ND arrays. However, real-world\n    42\tdatasets are usually more than just raw numbers; they have labels which\n    43\tencode information about how the array values map to locations in space,\n    44\ttime, etc.\n    45\t\n    46\tXarray doesn\\'t just keep track of labels on arrays \\-- it uses them to\n    47\tprovide a powerful and concise interface. For example:\n    48\t\n    49\t- Apply operations over dimensions by name: `x.sum('time')`.\n    50\t- Select values by label instead of integer location:\n    51\t  `x.loc['2014-01-01']` or `x.sel(time='2014-01-01')`.\n    52\t- Mathematical operations (e.g., `x - y`) vectorize across multiple\n    53\t  dimensions (array broadcasting) based on dimension names, not shape.\n    54\t- Flexible split-apply-combine operations with groupby:\n    55\t  `x.groupby('time.dayofyear').mean()`.\n    56\t- Database like alignment based on coordinate labels that smoothly\n    57\t  handles missing values: `x, y = xr.align(x, y, join='outer')`.\n    58\t- Keep track of arbitrary metadata in the form of a Python dictionary:\n    59\t  `x.attrs`.\n    60\t\n    61\t## Documentation\n    62\t\n    63\tLearn more about xarray in its official documentation at\n    64\t<https://docs.xarray.dev/>.\n    65\t\n    66\tTry out an [interactive Jupyter\n    67\tnotebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pydata/xarray/main?urlpath=lab/tree/doc/examples/weather-data.ipynb).\n    68\t\n    69\t## Contributing\n    70\t\n    71\tYou can find information about contributing to xarray at our\n    72\t[Contributing\n    73\tpage](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/contributing.html).\n    74\t\n    75\t## Get in touch\n    76\t\n    77\t- Ask usage questions (\"How do I?\") on\n    78\t  [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/discussions).\n    79\t- Report bugs, suggest features or view the source code [on\n    80\t  GitHub](https://github.com/pydata/xarray).\n    81\t- For less well defined questions or ideas, or to announce other\n    82\t  projects of interest to xarray users, use the [mailing\n    83\t  list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/xarray).\n    84\t\n    85\t## NumFOCUS\n    86\t\n    87\t<img src=\"https://numfocus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NumFocus_LRG.png\" width=\"200\" href=\"https://numfocus.org/\">\n    88\t\n    89\tXarray is a fiscally sponsored project of\n    90\t[NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org), a nonprofit dedicated to supporting\n    91\tthe open source scientific computing community.

Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>","tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"execute_bash","description":"Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1.

Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

In February\n   193\t2007, Fabian Pedregosa joined the project and helped fix many things,\n   194\tcontributed documentation, and made it alive again. 5 students (Mateusz\n   195\tPaprocki, Brian Jorgensen, Jason Gedge, Robert Schwarz, and Chris Wu)\n   196\timproved SymPy incredibly during summer 2007 as part of the Google\n   197\tSummer of Code. Pearu Peterson joined the development during the summer\n   198\t2007 and he has made SymPy much more competitive by rewriting the core\n   199\tfrom scratch, which has made it from 10x to 100x faster. Jurjen N.E. Bos\n   200\thas contributed pretty-printing and other patches. Fredrik Johansson has\n   201\twritten mpmath and contributed a lot of patches.\n   202\t\n   203\tSymPy has participated in every Google Summer of Code since 2007. You\n   204\tcan see <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki#google-summer-of-code> for\n   205\tfull details. Each year has improved SymPy by bounds. Most of SymPy's\n   206\tdevelopment has come from Google Summer of Code students.\n   207\t\n   208\tIn 2011, Ondřej Čertík stepped down as lead developer, with Aaron\n   209\tMeurer, who also started as a Google Summer of Code student, taking his\n   210\tplace. Ondřej Čertík is still active in the community but is too busy\n   211\twith work and family to play a lead development role.\n   212\t\n   213\tSince then, a lot more people have joined the development and some\n   214\tpeople have also left. You can see the full list in doc/src/aboutus.rst,\n   215\tor online at:\n   216\t\n   217\t<https://docs.sympy.org/dev/aboutus.html#sympy-development-team>\n   218\t\n   219\tThe git history goes back to 2007 when development moved from svn to hg.\n   220\tTo see the history before that point, look at\n   221\t<https://github.com/sympy/sympy-old>.\n   222\t\n   223\tYou can use git to see the biggest developers.

It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem.

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1.

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases.

Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished.

To [install the latest version of Prefect](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/get-started/install), run one of the following commands:\n\n```bash\npip install -U prefect\n```\n\n```bash\nuv add prefect\n```\n\nThen create and run a Python file that uses Prefect `flow` and `task` decorators to orchestrate and observe your workflow - in this case, a simple script that fetches the number of GitHub stars from a repository:\n\n```python\nfrom prefect import flow, task\nimport httpx\n\n\n@task(log_prints=True)\ndef get_stars(repo: str):\n    url = f\"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}\"\n    count = httpx.get(url).json()[\"stargazers_count\"]\n    print(f\"{repo} has {count} stars!\")\n\n\n@flow(name=\"GitHub Stars\")\ndef github_stars(repos: list[str]):\n    for repo in repos:\n        get_stars(repo)\n\n\n# run the flow!\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    github_stars([\"PrefectHQ/Prefect\"])\n```\n\nFire up a Prefect server and open the UI at http://localhost:4200 to see what happened:\n\n```bash\nprefect server start\n```\n\nTo run your workflow on a schedule, turn it into a deployment and schedule it to run every minute by changing the last line of your script to the following:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    github_stars.serve(\n        name=\"first-deployment\",\n        cron=\"* * * * *\",\n        parameters={\"repos\": [\"PrefectHQ/prefect\"]}\n    )\n```\n\nYou now have a process running locally that is looking for scheduled deployments!\nAdditionally you can run your workflow manually from the UI or CLI.

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3.

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases.

Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

Building packages as sdist or binary wheel and installing or publish to PyPI afterwards you use command\n    31\t    `python setup.py sdist` or `python setup.py bdist_wheel` accordingly.\n    32\t   In case you want to build just a particular package you want to set an environment variable:\n    33\t   `PACKAGE_NAME=lightning|pytorch|fabric python setup.py sdist|bdist_wheel`\n    34\t\n    35\t4.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

Somewhat similar to\n     9\tPython this happens to be 'good enough', but at the same time is deeply flawed and broken beyond repair.\n    10\t\n    11\tBy now, GitPython is widely used and I am sure there is a good reason for that, it's something to be proud of and happy about.\n    12\tThe community is maintaining the software and is keeping it relevant for which I am absolutely grateful. For the time to come I am happy to continue maintaining GitPython, remaining hopeful that one day it won't be needed anymore.\n    13\t\n    14\tMore than 15 years after my first meeting with 'git' I am still in excited about it, and am happy to finally have the tools and\n    15\tprobably the skills to scratch that itch of mine: implement `git` in a way that makes tool creation a piece of cake for most.\n    16\t\n    17\tIf you like the idea and want to learn more, please head over to [gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide), an\n    18\timplementation of 'git' in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).\n    19\t\n    20\t*(Please note that `gitoxide` is not currently available for use in Python, and that Rust is required.)*\n    21\t\n    22\t## GitPython\n    23\t\n    24\tGitPython is a python library used to interact with git repositories, high-level like git-porcelain,\n    25\tor low-level like git-plumbing.\n    26\t\n    27\tIt provides abstractions of git objects for easy access of repository data often backed by calling the `git`\n    28\tcommand-line program.\n    29\t\n    30\t### DEVELOPMENT STATUS\n    31\t\n    32\tThis project is in **maintenance mode**, which means that\n    33\t\n    34\t- …there will be no feature development, unless these are contributed\n    35\t- …there will be no bug fixes, unless they are relevant to the safety of users, or contributed\n    36\t- …issues will be responded to with waiting times of up to a month\n    37\t\n    38\tThe project is open to contributions of all kinds, as well as new maintainers.\n    39\t\n    40\t### REQUIREMENTS\n    41\t\n    42\tGitPython needs the `git` executable to be installed on the system and available in your\n    43\t`PATH` for most operations. If it is not in your `PATH`, you can help GitPython find it\n    44\tby setting the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE=<path/to/git>` environment variable.\n    45\t\n    46\t- Git (1.7.x or newer)\n    47\t- Python >= 3.7\n    48\t\n    49\tThe list of dependencies are listed in `./requirements.txt` and `./test-requirements.txt`.\n    50\tThe installer takes care of installing them for you.\n    51\t\n    52\t### INSTALL\n    53\t\n    54\tGitPython and its required package dependencies can be installed in any of the following ways, all of which should typically be done in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).\n    55\t\n    56\t#### From PyPI\n    57\t\n    58\tTo obtain and install a copy [from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/GitPython/), run:\n    59\t\n    60\t```sh\n    61\tpip install GitPython\n    62\t```\n    63\t\n    64\t(A distribution package can also be downloaded for manual installation at [the PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/GitPython/).)\n    65\t\n    66\t#### From downloaded source code\n    67\t\n    68\tIf you have downloaded the source code, run this from inside the unpacked `GitPython` directory:\n    69\t\n    70\t```sh\n    71\tpip install .\n    72\t```\n    73\t\n    74\t#### By cloning the source code repository\n    75\t\n    76\tTo clone the [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython) from source to work on the code, you can do it like so:\n    77\t\n    78\t```sh\n    79\tgit clone https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython\n    80\tcd GitPython\n    81\t./init-tests-after-clone.sh\n    82\t```\n    83\t\n    84\tOn Windows, `./init-tests-after-clone.sh` can be run in a Git Bash shell.\n    85\t\n    86\tIf you are cloning [your own fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks), then replace the above `git clone` command with one that gives the URL of your fork. Or use this [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) command (assuming you have `gh` and your fork is called `GitPython`):\n    87\t\n    88\t```sh\n    89\tgh repo clone GitPython\n    90\t```\n    91\t\n    92\tHaving cloned the repo, create and activate your [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).\n    93\t\n    94\tThen make an [editable install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs):\n    95\t\n    96\t```sh\n    97\tpip install -e \".[test]\"\n    98\t```\n    99\t\n   100\tIn the less common case that you do not want to install test dependencies, `pip install -e .` can be used instead.\n   101\t\n   102\t#### With editable *dependencies* (not preferred, and rarely needed)\n   103\t\n   104\tIn rare cases, you may want to work on GitPython and one or both of its [gitdb](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/gitdb) and [smmap](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/smmap) dependencies at the same time, with changes in your local working copy of gitdb or smmap immediately reflected in the behavior of your local working copy of GitPython. This can be done by making editable installations of those dependencies in the same virtual environment where you install GitPython.\n   105\t\n   106\tIf you want to do that *and* you want the versions in GitPython's git submodules to be used, then pass `-e git/ext/gitdb` and/or `-e git/ext/gitdb/gitdb/ext/smmap` to `pip install`. This can be done in any order, and in separate `pip install` commands or the same one, so long as `-e` appears before *each* path. For example, you can install GitPython, gitdb, and smmap editably in the currently active virtual environment this way:\n   107\t\n   108\t```sh\n   109\tpip install -e \".[test]\" -e git/ext/gitdb -e git/ext/gitdb/gitdb/ext/smmap\n   110\t```\n   111\t\n   112\tThe submodules must have been cloned for that to work, but that will already be the case if you have run `./init-tests-after-clone.sh`. You can use `pip list` to check which packages are installed editably and which are installed normally.\n   113\t\n   114\tTo reiterate, this approach should only rarely be used. For most development it is preferable to allow the gitdb and smmap dependencices to be retrieved automatically from PyPI in their latest stable packaged versions.\n   115\t\n   116\t### Limitations\n   117\t\n   118\t#### Leakage of System Resources\n   119\t\n   120\tGitPython is not suited for long-running processes (like daemons) as it tends to\n   121\tleak system resources. It was written in a time where destructors (as implemented\n   122\tin the `__del__` method) still ran deterministically.\n   123\t\n   124\tIn case you still want to use it in such a context, you will want to search the\n   125\tcodebase for `__del__` implementations and call these yourself when you see fit.\n   126\t\n   127\tAnother way assure proper cleanup of resources is to factor out GitPython into a\n   128\tseparate process which can be dropped periodically.\n   129\t\n   130\t#### Windows support\n   131\t\n   132\tSee [Issue #525](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/525).\n   133\t\n   134\t### RUNNING TESTS\n   135\t\n   136\t_Important_: Right after cloning this repository, please be sure to have executed\n   137\tthe `./init-tests-after-clone.sh` script in the repository root. Otherwise\n   138\tyou will encounter test failures.\n   139\t\n   140\t#### Install test dependencies\n   141\t\n   142\tEnsure testing libraries are installed. This is taken care of already if you installed with:\n   143\t\n   144\t```sh\n   145\tpip install -e \".[test]\"\n   146\t```\n   147\t\n   148\tIf you had installed with a command like `pip install -e .` instead, you can still run\n   149\tthe above command to add the testing dependencies.\n   150\t\n   151\t#### Test commands\n   152\t\n   153\tTo test, run:\n   154\t\n   155\t```sh\n   156\tpytest\n   157\t```\n   158\t\n   159\tTo lint, and apply some linting fixes as well as automatic code formatting, run:\n   160\t\n   161\t```sh\n   162\tpre-commit run --all-files\n   163\t```\n   164\t\n   165\tThis includes the linting and autoformatting done by Ruff, as well as some other checks.\n   166\t\n   167\tTo typecheck, run:\n   168\t\n   169\t```sh\n   170\tmypy\n   171\t```\n   172\t\n   173\t#### CI (and tox)\n   174\t\n   175\tStyle and formatting checks, and running tests on all the different supported Python versions, will be performed:\n   176\t\n   177\t- Upon submitting a pull request.\n   178\t- On each push, *if* you have a fork with GitHub Actions enabled.\n   179\t- Locally, if you run [`tox`](https://tox.wiki/) (this skips any Python versions you don't have installed).\n   180\t\n   181\t#### Configuration files\n   182\t\n   183\tSpecific tools are all configured in the `./pyproject.toml` file:\n   184\t\n   185\t- `pytest` (test runner)\n   186\t- `coverage.py` (code coverage)\n   187\t- `ruff` (linter and formatter)\n   188\t- `mypy` (type checker)\n   189\t\n   190\tOrchestration tools:\n   191\t\n   192\t- Configuration for `pre-commit` is in the `./.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.\n   193\t- Configuration for `tox` is in `./tox.ini`.\n   194\t- Configuration for GitHub Actions (CI) is in files inside `./.github/workflows/`.\n   195\t\n   196\t### Contributions\n   197\t\n   198\tPlease have a look at the [contributions file][contributing].\n   199\t\n   200\t### INFRASTRUCTURE\n   201\t\n   202\t- [User Documentation](http://gitpython.readthedocs.org)\n   203\t- [Questions and Answers](http://stackexchange.com/filters/167317/gitpython)\n   204\t- Please post on Stack Overflow and use the `gitpython` tag\n   205\t- [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues)\n   206\t  - Post reproducible bugs and feature requests as a new issue.\n   207\t    Please be sure to provide the following information if posting bugs:\n   208\t    - GitPython version (e.g. `import git; git.__version__`)\n   209\t    - Python version (e.g. `python --version`)\n   210\t    - The encountered stack-trace, if applicable\n   211\t    - Enough information to allow reproducing the issue\n   212\t\n   213\t### How to make a new release\n   214\t\n   215\t1.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

acts as the model-definition framework for state-of-the-art machine learning models in text, computer \n    67\tvision, audio, video, and multimodal model, for both inference and training. \n    68\t\n    69\tIt centralizes the model definition so that this definition is agreed upon across the ecosystem. `transformers` is the \n    70\tpivot across frameworks: if a model definition is supported, it will be compatible with the majority of training \n    71\tframeworks (Axolotl, Unsloth, DeepSpeed, FSDP, PyTorch-Lightning, ...), inference engines (vLLM, SGLang, TGI, ...),\n    72\tand adjacent modeling libraries (llama.cpp, mlx, ...) which leverage the model definition from `transformers`.\n    73\t\n    74\tWe pledge to help support new state-of-the-art models and democratize their usage by having their model definition be\n    75\tsimple, customizable, and efficient.\n    76\t\n    77\tThere are over 1M+ Transformers [model checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers&sort=trending) on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.com/models) you can use.\n    78\t\n    79\tExplore the [Hub](https://huggingface.com/) today to find a model and use Transformers to help you get started right away.\n    80\t\n    81\t## Installation\n    82\t\n    83\tTransformers works with Python 3.9+ [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) 2.1+, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) 2.6+, and [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 0.4.1+.\n    84\t\n    85\tCreate and activate a virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a fast Rust-based Python package and project manager.\n    86\t\n    87\t```py\n    88\t# venv\n    89\tpython -m venv .my-env\n    90\tsource .my-env/bin/activate\n    91\t# uv\n    92\tuv venv .my-env\n    93\tsource .my-env/bin/activate\n    94\t```\n    95\t\n    96\tInstall Transformers in your virtual environment.\n    97\t\n    98\t```py\n    99\t# pip\n   100\tpip install \"transformers[torch]\"\n   101\t\n   102\t# uv\n   103\tuv pip install \"transformers[torch]\"\n   104\t```\n   105\t\n   106\tInstall Transformers from source if you want the latest changes in the library or are interested in contributing. However, the *latest* version may not be stable. Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues) if you encounter an error.\n   107\t\n   108\t```shell\n   109\tgit clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git\n   110\tcd transformers\n   111\t\n   112\t# pip\n   113\tpip install .[torch]\n   114\t\n   115\t# uv\n   116\tuv pip install .[torch]\n   117\t```\n   118\t\n   119\t## Quickstart\n   120\t\n   121\tGet started with Transformers right away with the [Pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/pipeline_tutorial) API. The `Pipeline` is a high-level inference class that supports text, audio, vision, and multimodal tasks. It handles preprocessing the input and returns the appropriate output.\n   122\t\n   123\tInstantiate a pipeline and specify model to use for text generation. The model is downloaded and cached so you can easily reuse it again. Finally, pass some text to prompt the model.\n   124\t\n   125\t```py\n   126\tfrom transformers import pipeline\n   127\t\n   128\tpipeline = pipeline(task=\"text-generation\", model=\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B\")\n   129\tpipeline(\"the secret to baking a really good cake is \")\n   130\t[{'generated_text': 'the secret to baking a really good cake is 1) to use the right ingredients and 2) to follow the recipe exactly. the recipe for the cake is as follows: 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of butter, 1 cup of eggs, 1 cup of chocolate chips. if you want to make 2 cakes, how much sugar do you need?

Easy-to-use state-of-the-art models:\n   217\t    - High performance on natural language understanding & generation, computer vision, audio, video, and multimodal tasks.\n   218\t    - Low barrier to entry for researchers, engineers, and developers.\n   219\t    - Few user-facing abstractions with just three classes to learn.\n   220\t    - A unified API for using all our pretrained models.\n   221\t\n   222\t1. Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:\n   223\t    - Share trained models instead of training from scratch.\n   224\t    - Reduce compute time and production costs.\n   225\t    - Dozens of model architectures with 1M+ pretrained checkpoints across all modalities.\n   226\t\n   227\t1. Choose the right framework for every part of a models lifetime:\n   228\t    - Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code.\n   229\t    - Move a single model between PyTorch/JAX/TF2.0 frameworks at will.\n   230\t    - Pick the right framework for training, evaluation, and production.\n   231\t\n   232\t1. Easily customize a model or an example to your needs:\n   233\t    - We provide examples for each architecture to reproduce the results published by its original authors.\n   234\t    - Model internals are exposed as consistently as possible.\n   235\t    - Model files can be used independently of the library for quick experiments.\n   236\t\n   237\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/enterprise\">\n   238\t    <img alt=\"Hugging Face Enterprise Hub\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/247fb16d-d251-4583-96c4-d3d76dda4925\">\n   239\t</a><br>\n   240\t\n   241\t## Why shouldn't I use Transformers?\n   242\t\n   243\t- This library is not a modular toolbox of building blocks for neural nets. The code in the model files is not refactored with additional abstractions on purpose, so that researchers can quickly iterate on each of the models without diving into additional abstractions/files.\n   244\t- The training API is optimized to work with PyTorch models provided by Transformers. For generic machine learning loops, you should use another library like [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate).\n   245\t- The [example scripts]((https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples)) are only *examples*. They may not necessarily work out-of-the-box on your specific use case and you'll need to adapt the code for it to work.\n   246\t\n   247\t## 100 projects using Transformers\n   248\t\n   249\tTransformers is more than a toolkit to use pretrained models, it's a community of projects built around it and the\n   250\tHugging Face Hub.

For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished.

In your source root must exist a\n    59\tfile called `meson.build`. To generate the build system run this\n    60\tcommand:\n    61\t\n    62\t`meson setup <source directory> <build directory>`\n    63\t\n    64\tDepending on how you obtained Meson the command might also be called\n    65\t`meson.py` instead of plain `meson`. In the rest of this document we\n    66\tare going to use the latter form.\n    67\t\n    68\tYou can omit either of the two directories, and Meson will substitute\n    69\tthe current directory and autodetect what you mean. This allows you to\n    70\tdo things like this:\n    71\t\n    72\t```console\n    73\tcd <source root>\n    74\tmeson setup builddir\n    75\t```\n    76\t\n    77\tTo compile, cd into your build directory and type `ninja`. To run unit\n    78\ttests, type `ninja test`.\n    79\t\n    80\tMore on running Meson build system commands can be found at the\n    81\t[running meson page](https://mesonbuild.com/Running-Meson.html)\n    82\tor by typing `meson --help`.\n    83\t\n    84\t#### Contributing\n    85\t\n    86\tWe love code contributions.

It supports reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation)\n    26\tvia [`jax.grad`](#automatic-differentiation-with-grad) as well as forward-mode differentiation,\n    27\tand the two can be composed arbitrarily to any order.\n    28\t\n    29\tJAX uses [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla)\n    30\tto compile and scale your NumPy programs on TPUs, GPUs, and other hardware accelerators.\n    31\tYou can compile your own pure functions with [`jax.jit`](#compilation-with-jit).\n    32\tCompilation and automatic differentiation can be composed arbitrarily.\n    33\t\n    34\tDig a little deeper, and you'll see that JAX is really an extensible system for\n    35\t[composable function transformations](#transformations) at [scale](#scaling).\n    36\t\n    37\tThis is a research project, not an official Google product.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished.

It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\n    22\tdoing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\n    23\tthe broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\n    24\tanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\n    25\tits way towards this goal.\n    26\t\n    27\t## Table of Contents\n    28\t\n    29\t- [Main Features](#main-features)\n    30\t- [Where to get it](#where-to-get-it)\n    31\t- [Dependencies](#dependencies)\n    32\t- [Installation from sources](#installation-from-sources)\n    33\t- [License](#license)\n    34\t- [Documentation](#documentation)\n    35\t- [Background](#background)\n    36\t- [Getting Help](#getting-help)\n    37\t- [Discussion and Development](#discussion-and-development)\n    38\t- [Contributing to pandas](#contributing-to-pandas)\n    39\t\n    40\t## Main Features\n    41\tHere are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n    42\t\n    43\t  - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as\n    44\t    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n    45\t  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and\n    46\t    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional\n    47\t    objects\n    48\t  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can\n    49\t    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply\n    50\t    ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically\n    51\t    align the data for you in computations\n    52\t  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform\n    53\t    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating\n    54\t    and transforming data\n    55\t  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,\n    56\t    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures\n    57\t    into DataFrame objects\n    58\t  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy\n    59\t    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of\n    60\t    large data sets\n    61\t  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data\n    62\t    sets\n    63\t  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of\n    64\t    data sets\n    65\t  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple\n    66\t    labels per tick)\n    67\t  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]\n    68\t    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],\n    69\t    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]\n    70\t  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range\n    71\t    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,\n    72\t    date shifting and lagging\n    73\t\n    74\t\n    75\t   [missing-data]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html\n    76\t   [insertion-deletion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#column-selection-addition-deletion\n    77\t   [alignment]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html?highlight=alignment#intro-to-data-structures\n    78\t   [groupby]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#group-by-split-apply-combine\n    79\t   [conversion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe\n    80\t   [slicing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#slicing-ranges\n    81\t   [fancy-indexing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html#advanced\n    82\t   [subsetting]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing\n    83\t   [merging]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-or-named-series-joining-merging\n    84\t   [joining]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#joining-on-index\n    85\t   [reshape]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n    86\t   [pivot-table]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n    87\t   [mi]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#hierarchical-indexing-multiindex\n    88\t   [flat-files]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#csv-text-files\n    89\t   [excel]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#excel-files\n    90\t   [db]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#sql-queries\n    91\t   [hdfstore]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#hdf5-pytables\n    92\t   [timeseries]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#time-series-date-functionality\n    93\t\n    94\t## Where to get it\n    95\tThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:\n    96\thttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\n    97\t\n    98\tBinary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python\n    99\tPackage Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas) and on [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pandas).\n   100\t\n   101\t```sh\n   102\t# conda\n   103\tconda install -c conda-forge pandas\n   104\t```\n   105\t\n   106\t```sh\n   107\t# or PyPI\n   108\tpip install pandas\n   109\t```\n   110\t\n   111\tThe list of changes to pandas between each release can be found\n   112\t[here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/index.html).

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. It is\n    72\ta part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.\n    73\t\n    74\tThe main branch works with **PyTorch 1.8+**.\n    75\t\n    76\t<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12907710/187674113-2074d658-f2fb-42d1-ac15-9c4a695e64d7.png\"/>\n    77\t\n    78\t<details open>\n    79\t<summary>Major features</summary>\n    80\t\n    81\t- **Modular Design**\n    82\t\n    83\t  We decompose the detection framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized object detection framework by combining different modules.\n    84\t\n    85\t- **Support of multiple tasks out of box**\n    86\t\n    87\t  The toolbox directly supports multiple detection tasks such as **object detection**, **instance segmentation**, **panoptic segmentation**, and **semi-supervised object detection**.\n    88\t\n    89\t- **High efficiency**\n    90\t\n    91\t  All basic bbox and mask operations run on GPUs. The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases, including [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark) and [SimpleDet](https://github.com/TuSimple/simpledet).\n    92\t\n    93\t- **State of the art**\n    94\t\n    95\t  The toolbox stems from the codebase developed by the *MMDet* team, who won [COCO Detection Challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard) in 2018, and we keep pushing it forward.\n    96\t  The newly released [RTMDet](configs/rtmdet) also obtains new state-of-the-art results on real-time instance segmentation and rotated object detection tasks and the best parameter-accuracy trade-off on object detection.\n    97\t\n    98\t</details>\n    99\t\n   100\tApart from MMDetection, we also released [MMEngine](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine) for model training and [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) for computer vision research, which are heavily depended on by this toolbox.\n   101\t\n   102\t## What's New\n   103\t\n   104\t💎 **We have released the pre-trained weights for MM-Grounding-DINO Swin-B and Swin-L, welcome to try and give feedback.**\n   105\t\n   106\t### Highlight\n   107\t\n   108\t**v3.3.0** was released in 5/1/2024:\n   109\t\n   110\t**[MM-Grounding-DINO: An Open and Comprehensive Pipeline for Unified Object Grounding and Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02361)**\n   111\t\n   112\tGrounding DINO is a grounding pre-training model that unifies 2d open vocabulary object detection and phrase grounding, with wide applications. However, its training part has not been open sourced. Therefore, we propose MM-Grounding-DINO, which not only serves as an open source replication version of Grounding DINO, but also achieves significant performance improvement based on reconstructed data types, exploring different dataset combinations and initialization strategies. Moreover, we conduct evaluations from multiple dimensions, including OOD, REC, Phrase Grounding, OVD, and Fine-tune, to fully excavate the advantages and disadvantages of Grounding pre-training, hoping to provide inspiration for future work.\n   113\t\n   114\tcode: [mm_grounding_dino/README.md](configs/mm_grounding_dino/README.md)\n   115\t\n   116\t<div align=center>\n   117\t<img src=\"https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/assets/17425982/fb14d1ee-5469-44d2-b865-aac9850c429c\"/>\n   118\t</div>\n   119\t\n   120\tWe are excited to announce our latest work on real-time object recognition tasks, **RTMDet**, a family of fully convolutional single-stage detectors. RTMDet not only achieves the best parameter-accuracy trade-off on object detection from tiny to extra-large model sizes but also obtains new state-of-the-art performance on instance segmentation and rotated object detection tasks. Details can be found in the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07784).

For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished.

Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>","tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"execute_bash","description":"Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>","tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"execute_bash","description":"Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.
