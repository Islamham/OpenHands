If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"description":"The commands to run.

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

The paper provides an introduction to the key features of the library, and it can be used as a citation if seaborn proves integral to a scientific publication.\n    55\t\n    56\tTesting\n    57\t-------\n    58\t\n    59\tTesting seaborn requires installing additional dependencies; they can be installed with the `dev` extra (e.g., `pip install .[dev]`).\n    60\t\n    61\tTo test the code, run `make test` in the source directory. This will exercise the unit tests (using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)) and generate a coverage report.\n    62\t\n    63\tCode style is enforced with `flake8` using the settings in the [`setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg) file. Run `make lint` to check. Alternately, you can use `pre-commit` to automatically run lint checks on any files you are committing: just run `pre-commit install` to set it up, and then commit as usual going forward.\n    64\t\n    65\tDevelopment\n    66\t-----------\n    67\t\n    68\tSeaborn development takes place on Github: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn\n    69\t\n    70\tPlease submit bugs that you encounter to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues) with a reproducible example demonstrating the problem.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

After receiving test results, use this tool to brainstorm ways to fix failing tests.\n3. When planning a complex refactoring, use this tool to outline different approaches and their tradeoffs.\n4. When designing a new feature, use this tool to think through architecture decisions and implementation details.\n5.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished.

As a pure Python package,\n    13\t*pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working\n    14\twith *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](https://numpy.org).\n    15\t\n    16\tNote that *pydicom* is a general-purpose DICOM framework concerned with\n    17\treading and writing DICOM datasets. In order to keep the\n    18\tproject manageable, it does not handle the specifics of individual SOP classes\n    19\tor other aspects of DICOM. Other libraries both inside and outside the\n    20\t[pydicom organization](https://github.com/pydicom) are based on *pydicom*\n    21\tand provide support for other aspects of DICOM, and for more\n    22\tspecific applications.\n    23\t\n    24\tExamples are [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom), which\n    25\tis a Python library for DICOM networking, and [deid](https://github.com/pydicom/deid),\n    26\twhich supports the anonymization of DICOM files.\n    27\t\n    28\t\n    29\t## Installation\n    30\t\n    31\tUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n    32\t```\n    33\tpip install pydicom\n    34\t```\n    35\tUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n    36\t```\n    37\tconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n    38\t```\n    39\t\n    40\tFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n    41\t\n    42\t\n    43\t## Documentation\n    44\t\n    45\tThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/guides/user/index.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n    46\t\n    47\t## *Pixel Data*\n    48\t\n    49\tCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\n    50\tbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n    51\t```python\n    52\t>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n    53\t>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n    54\t>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n    55\t>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n    56\t>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n    57\t<class 'bytes'>\n    58\t>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n    59\t32768\n    60\t>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\n    61\tb'\\xaf\\x00'\n    62\t\n    63\t```\n    64\t\n    65\tIf [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n    66\t\n    67\t```python\n    68\t>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n    69\t>>> arr.shape\n    70\t(128, 128)\n    71\t>>> arr\n    72\tarray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n    73\t       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n    74\t       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n    75\t       ...,\n    76\t       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n    77\t       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n    78\t       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n    79\t```\n    80\t### Decompressing *Pixel Data*\n    81\t#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\n    82\tConverting JPEG, JPEG-LS or JPEG 2000 compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/guides/user/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n    83\t\n    84\t#### RLE\n    85\tDecompressing RLE *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, however it can be quite slow. You may want to consider [installing one or more additional Python libraries](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/guides/user/image_data_compression.html) to speed up the process.\n    86\t\n    87\t### Compressing *Pixel Data*\n    88\tInformation on compressing *Pixel Data* using one of the below formats can be found in the corresponding [encoding guides](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/guides/encoding/index.html). These guides cover the specific requirements for each encoding method and we recommend you be familiar with them when performing image compression.\n    89\t\n    90\t#### JPEG-LS, JPEG 2000\n    91\tCompressing image data from an ``ndarray`` or ``bytes`` object to JPEG-LS or JPEG 2000 requires installing the following:\n    92\t\n    93\t* JPEG-LS requires [pyjpegls](https://github.com/pydicom/pyjpegls)\n    94\t* JPEG 2000 requires [pylibjpeg](https://github.com/pydicom/pylibjpeg) and the [pylibjpeg-openjpeg](https://github.com/pydicom/pylibjpeg-openjpeg) plugin\n    95\t\n    96\t#### RLE\n    97\tCompressing using RLE requires no additional packages but can be quite slow. It can be sped up by installing [pylibjpeg](https://github.com/pydicom/pylibjpeg) with the [pylibjpeg-rle](https://github.com/pydicom/pylibjpeg-rle) plugin, or [gdcm](https://github.com/tfmoraes/python-gdcm).\n    98\t\n    99\t\n   100\t## Examples\n   101\tMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n   102\t\n   103\t**Change a patient's ID**\n   104\t```python\n   105\tfrom pydicom import dcmread\n   106\t\n   107\tds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n   108\t# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\n   109\tds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\n   110\tds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n   111\t```\n   112\t\n   113\t**Display the Pixel Data**\n   114\t\n   115\tWith [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n   116\t```python\n   117\timport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   118\tfrom pydicom import dcmread, examples\n   119\t\n   120\t# The path to the example \"ct\" dataset included with pydicom\n   121\tpath: \"pathlib.Path\" = examples.get_path(\"ct\")\n   122\tds = dcmread(path)\n   123\t# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\n   124\tarr = ds.pixel_array\n   125\t\n   126\tplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\n   127\tplt.show()\n   128\t```\n   129\t\n   130\t## Contributing\n   131\t\n   132\tWe are all volunteers working on *pydicom* in our free time.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

The package includes a large and growing library\n    24\tof domain-agnostic functions for advanced analytics and visualization\n    25\twith these data structures.\n    26\t\n    27\tXarray was inspired by and borrows heavily from\n    28\t[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), the popular data analysis package\n    29\tfocused on labelled tabular data. It is particularly tailored to working\n    30\twith [netCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf) files, which\n    31\twere the source of xarray\\'s data model, and integrates tightly with\n    32\t[dask](https://dask.org) for parallel computing.\n    33\t\n    34\t## Why xarray?\n    35\t\n    36\tMulti-dimensional (a.k.a. N-dimensional, ND) arrays (sometimes called\n    37\t\"tensors\") are an essential part of computational science. They are\n    38\tencountered in a wide range of fields, including physics, astronomy,\n    39\tgeoscience, bioinformatics, engineering, finance, and deep learning. In\n    40\tPython, [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org) provides the fundamental data\n    41\tstructure and API for working with raw ND arrays. However, real-world\n    42\tdatasets are usually more than just raw numbers; they have labels which\n    43\tencode information about how the array values map to locations in space,\n    44\ttime, etc.\n    45\t\n    46\tXarray doesn\\'t just keep track of labels on arrays \\-- it uses them to\n    47\tprovide a powerful and concise interface. For example:\n    48\t\n    49\t- Apply operations over dimensions by name: `x.sum('time')`.\n    50\t- Select values by label instead of integer location:\n    51\t  `x.loc['2014-01-01']` or `x.sel(time='2014-01-01')`.\n    52\t- Mathematical operations (e.g., `x - y`) vectorize across multiple\n    53\t  dimensions (array broadcasting) based on dimension names, not shape.\n    54\t- Flexible split-apply-combine operations with groupby:\n    55\t  `x.groupby('time.dayofyear').mean()`.\n    56\t- Database like alignment based on coordinate labels that smoothly\n    57\t  handles missing values: `x, y = xr.align(x, y, join='outer')`.\n    58\t- Keep track of arbitrary metadata in the form of a Python dictionary:\n    59\t  `x.attrs`.\n    60\t\n    61\t## Documentation\n    62\t\n    63\tLearn more about xarray in its official documentation at\n    64\t<https://docs.xarray.dev/>.\n    65\t\n    66\tTry out an [interactive Jupyter\n    67\tnotebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pydata/xarray/main?urlpath=lab/tree/doc/examples/weather-data.ipynb).\n    68\t\n    69\t## Contributing\n    70\t\n    71\tYou can find information about contributing to xarray at our\n    72\t[Contributing\n    73\tpage](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/contributing.html).\n    74\t\n    75\t## Get in touch\n    76\t\n    77\t- Ask usage questions (\"How do I?\") on\n    78\t  [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/discussions).\n    79\t- Report bugs, suggest features or view the source code [on\n    80\t  GitHub](https://github.com/pydata/xarray).\n    81\t- For less well defined questions or ideas, or to announce other\n    82\t  projects of interest to xarray users, use the [mailing\n    83\t  list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/xarray).\n    84\t\n    85\t## NumFOCUS\n    86\t\n    87\t<img src=\"https://numfocus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NumFocus_LRG.png\" width=\"200\" href=\"https://numfocus.org/\">\n    88\t\n    89\tXarray is a fiscally sponsored project of\n    90\t[NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org), a nonprofit dedicated to supporting\n    91\tthe open source scientific computing community.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished.

After receiving test results, use this tool to brainstorm ways to fix failing tests.\n3. When planning a complex refactoring, use this tool to outline different approaches and their tradeoffs.\n4. When designing a new feature, use this tool to think through architecture decisions and implementation details.\n5. When debugging a complex issue, use this tool to organize your thoughts and hypotheses.\n\nThe tool simply logs your thought process for better transparency and does not execute any code or make changes.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"thought":{"type":"string","description":"The thought to log."}},"required":["thought"]}}},{"type":"function","function":{"name":"finish","description":"Signals the completion of the current task or conversation.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- You have successfully completed the user's requested task\n- You cannot proceed further due to technical limitations or missing information\n\nThe message should include:\n- A clear summary of actions taken and their results\n- Any next steps for the user\n- Explanation if you're unable to complete the task\n- Any follow-up questions if more information is needed\n\nThe task_completed field should be set to True if you believed you have completed the task, and False otherwise.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","required":["message","task_completed"],"properties":{"message":{"type":"string","description":"Final message to send to the user"},"task_completed":{"type":"string","enum":["true","false","partial"],"description":"Whether you have completed the task."}}}}},{"type":"function","function":{"name":"str_replace_editor","description":"Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"description":"The commands to run.

Then export the `CLASSPATH` as instructed\n   149\tand instead of creating `antlr4` as an alias, make it an executable file\n   150\twith the following contents:\n   151\t``` bash\n   152\t#!/bin/bash\n   153\tjava -jar /usr/local/lib/antlr-4.11.1-complete.jar \"$@\"\n   154\t```\n   155\t\n   156\tAfter making changes to `sympy/parsing/latex/LaTeX.g4`, run:\n   157\t\n   158\t    $ ./setup.py antlr\n   159\t\n   160\t## Clean\n   161\t\n   162\tTo clean everything (thus getting the same tree as in the repository):\n   163\t\n   164\t    $ git clean -Xdf\n   165\t\n   166\twhich will clear everything ignored by `.gitignore`, and:\n   167\t\n   168\t    $ git clean -df\n   169\t\n   170\tto clear all untracked files. You can revert the most recent changes in\n   171\tgit with:\n   172\t\n   173\t    $ git reset --hard\n   174\t\n   175\tWARNING: The above commands will all clear changes you may have made,\n   176\tand you will lose them forever. Be sure to check things with `git\n   177\tstatus`, `git diff`, `git clean -Xn`, and `git clean -n` before doing any\n   178\tof those.\n   179\t\n   180\t## Bugs\n   181\t\n   182\tOur issue tracker is at <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues>.

In February\n   193\t2007, Fabian Pedregosa joined the project and helped fix many things,\n   194\tcontributed documentation, and made it alive again. 5 students (Mateusz\n   195\tPaprocki, Brian Jorgensen, Jason Gedge, Robert Schwarz, and Chris Wu)\n   196\timproved SymPy incredibly during summer 2007 as part of the Google\n   197\tSummer of Code. Pearu Peterson joined the development during the summer\n   198\t2007 and he has made SymPy much more competitive by rewriting the core\n   199\tfrom scratch, which has made it from 10x to 100x faster. Jurjen N.E. Bos\n   200\thas contributed pretty-printing and other patches. Fredrik Johansson has\n   201\twritten mpmath and contributed a lot of patches.\n   202\t\n   203\tSymPy has participated in every Google Summer of Code since 2007. You\n   204\tcan see <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki#google-summer-of-code> for\n   205\tfull details. Each year has improved SymPy by bounds. Most of SymPy's\n   206\tdevelopment has come from Google Summer of Code students.\n   207\t\n   208\tIn 2011, Ondřej Čertík stepped down as lead developer, with Aaron\n   209\tMeurer, who also started as a Google Summer of Code student, taking his\n   210\tplace. Ondřej Čertík is still active in the community but is too busy\n   211\twith work and family to play a lead development role.\n   212\t\n   213\tSince then, a lot more people have joined the development and some\n   214\tpeople have also left. You can see the full list in doc/src/aboutus.rst,\n   215\tor online at:\n   216\t\n   217\t<https://docs.sympy.org/dev/aboutus.html#sympy-development-team>\n   218\t\n   219\tThe git history goes back to 2007 when development moved from svn to hg.\n   220\tTo see the history before that point, look at\n   221\t<https://github.com/sympy/sympy-old>.\n   222\t\n   223\tYou can use git to see the biggest developers. The command:\n   224\t\n   225\t    $ git shortlog -ns\n   226\t\n   227\twill show each developer, sorted by commits to the project. The command:\n   228\t\n   229\t    $ git shortlog -ns --since=\"1 year\"\n   230\t\n   231\twill show the top developers from the last year.\n   232\t\n   233\t## Citation\n   234\t\n   235\tTo cite SymPy in publications use\n   236\t\n   237\t> Meurer A, Smith CP, Paprocki M, Čertík O, Kirpichev SB, Rocklin M,\n   238\t> Kumar A, Ivanov S, Moore JK, Singh S, Rathnayake T, Vig S, Granger BE,\n   239\t> Muller RP, Bonazzi F, Gupta H, Vats S, Johansson F, Pedregosa F, Curry\n   240\t> MJ, Terrel AR, Roučka Š, Saboo A, Fernando I, Kulal S, Cimrman R,\n   241\t> Scopatz A.

For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished.

Users can host their packages on their servers, privately. Integrates with Artifactory and Bintray.\n    24\t- Portable. Works across all platforms, including Linux, OSX, Windows (with native and first-class support, WSL, MinGW),\n    25\t  Solaris, FreeBSD, embedded and cross-compiling, docker, WSL\n    26\t- Manage binaries. It can create, upload and download binaries for any configuration and platform,\n    27\t  even cross-compiling, saving lots of time in development and continuous integration. The binary compatibility can be configured\n    28\t  and customized. Manage all your artifacts in the same way on all platforms.\n    29\t- Integrates with any build system, including any proprietary and custom one. Provides tested support for major build systems\n    30\t  (CMake, MSBuild, Makefiles, Meson, etc).\n    31\t- Extensible: Its Python-based recipes, together with extension points allow for great power and flexibility.\n    32\t- Large and active community, especially in GitHub (https://github.com/conan-io/conan) and Slack (https://cppalliance.org/slack/ #conan channel).\n    33\t  This community also creates and maintains packages in ConanCenter and Bincrafters repositories in Bintray.\n    34\t- Stable. Used in production by many companies, since 1.0 there is a commitment not to break package recipes and documented behavior.\n    35\t\n    36\t\n    37\tThis is the **developer/maintainer** documentation.

Some Linux distros won't allow you to put Python packages in editable mode in the root Python installation, and creating a virtual environment ``venv`` first, is mandatory.\n    61\t\n    62\t- **You are ready, try to run Conan:**\n    63\t\n    64\t  ```bash\n    65\t  $ conan --help\n    66\t\n    67\t  Consumer commands\n    68\t    install    Installs the requirements specified in a recipe (conanfile.py or conanfile.txt).\n    69\t    ...\n    70\t\n    71\t    Conan commands.

Those tests should add the attribute\n   139\t`artifactory_ready`.\n   140\t\n   141\t```bash\n   142\t$ python -m pytest . -m artifactory_ready\n   143\t```\n   144\t\n   145\tSome environment variables have to be defined to run them. For example, for an\n   146\tArtifactory instance that is running on the localhost with default user and password configured, the\n   147\tvariables could take the values:\n   148\t\n   149\t```bash\n   150\t$ export CONAN_TEST_WITH_ARTIFACTORY=1\n   151\t$ export ARTIFACTORY_DEFAULT_URL=http://localhost:8081/artifactory\n   152\t$ export ARTIFACTORY_DEFAULT_USER=admin\n   153\t$ export ARTIFACTORY_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=password\n   154\t```\n   155\t\n   156\t`ARTIFACTORY_DEFAULT_URL` is the base URL for the Artifactory repo, not one for a specific\n   157\trepository.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

Somewhat similar to\n     9\tPython this happens to be 'good enough', but at the same time is deeply flawed and broken beyond repair.\n    10\t\n    11\tBy now, GitPython is widely used and I am sure there is a good reason for that, it's something to be proud of and happy about.\n    12\tThe community is maintaining the software and is keeping it relevant for which I am absolutely grateful. For the time to come I am happy to continue maintaining GitPython, remaining hopeful that one day it won't be needed anymore.\n    13\t\n    14\tMore than 15 years after my first meeting with 'git' I am still in excited about it, and am happy to finally have the tools and\n    15\tprobably the skills to scratch that itch of mine: implement `git` in a way that makes tool creation a piece of cake for most.\n    16\t\n    17\tIf you like the idea and want to learn more, please head over to [gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide), an\n    18\timplementation of 'git' in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).\n    19\t\n    20\t*(Please note that `gitoxide` is not currently available for use in Python, and that Rust is required.)*\n    21\t\n    22\t## GitPython\n    23\t\n    24\tGitPython is a python library used to interact with git repositories, high-level like git-porcelain,\n    25\tor low-level like git-plumbing.\n    26\t\n    27\tIt provides abstractions of git objects for easy access of repository data often backed by calling the `git`\n    28\tcommand-line program.\n    29\t\n    30\t### DEVELOPMENT STATUS\n    31\t\n    32\tThis project is in **maintenance mode**, which means that\n    33\t\n    34\t- …there will be no feature development, unless these are contributed\n    35\t- …there will be no bug fixes, unless they are relevant to the safety of users, or contributed\n    36\t- …issues will be responded to with waiting times of up to a month\n    37\t\n    38\tThe project is open to contributions of all kinds, as well as new maintainers.\n    39\t\n    40\t### REQUIREMENTS\n    41\t\n    42\tGitPython needs the `git` executable to be installed on the system and available in your\n    43\t`PATH` for most operations. If it is not in your `PATH`, you can help GitPython find it\n    44\tby setting the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE=<path/to/git>` environment variable.\n    45\t\n    46\t- Git (1.7.x or newer)\n    47\t- Python >= 3.7\n    48\t\n    49\tThe list of dependencies are listed in `./requirements.txt` and `./test-requirements.txt`.\n    50\tThe installer takes care of installing them for you.\n    51\t\n    52\t### INSTALL\n    53\t\n    54\tGitPython and its required package dependencies can be installed in any of the following ways, all of which should typically be done in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).\n    55\t\n    56\t#### From PyPI\n    57\t\n    58\tTo obtain and install a copy [from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/GitPython/), run:\n    59\t\n    60\t```sh\n    61\tpip install GitPython\n    62\t```\n    63\t\n    64\t(A distribution package can also be downloaded for manual installation at [the PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/GitPython/).)\n    65\t\n    66\t#### From downloaded source code\n    67\t\n    68\tIf you have downloaded the source code, run this from inside the unpacked `GitPython` directory:\n    69\t\n    70\t```sh\n    71\tpip install .\n    72\t```\n    73\t\n    74\t#### By cloning the source code repository\n    75\t\n    76\tTo clone the [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython) from source to work on the code, you can do it like so:\n    77\t\n    78\t```sh\n    79\tgit clone https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython\n    80\tcd GitPython\n    81\t./init-tests-after-clone.sh\n    82\t```\n    83\t\n    84\tOn Windows, `./init-tests-after-clone.sh` can be run in a Git Bash shell.\n    85\t\n    86\tIf you are cloning [your own fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks), then replace the above `git clone` command with one that gives the URL of your fork. Or use this [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) command (assuming you have `gh` and your fork is called `GitPython`):\n    87\t\n    88\t```sh\n    89\tgh repo clone GitPython\n    90\t```\n    91\t\n    92\tHaving cloned the repo, create and activate your [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).\n    93\t\n    94\tThen make an [editable install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs):\n    95\t\n    96\t```sh\n    97\tpip install -e \".[test]\"\n    98\t```\n    99\t\n   100\tIn the less common case that you do not want to install test dependencies, `pip install -e .` can be used instead.\n   101\t\n   102\t#### With editable *dependencies* (not preferred, and rarely needed)\n   103\t\n   104\tIn rare cases, you may want to work on GitPython and one or both of its [gitdb](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/gitdb) and [smmap](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/smmap) dependencies at the same time, with changes in your local working copy of gitdb or smmap immediately reflected in the behavior of your local working copy of GitPython. This can be done by making editable installations of those dependencies in the same virtual environment where you install GitPython.\n   105\t\n   106\tIf you want to do that *and* you want the versions in GitPython's git submodules to be used, then pass `-e git/ext/gitdb` and/or `-e git/ext/gitdb/gitdb/ext/smmap` to `pip install`. This can be done in any order, and in separate `pip install` commands or the same one, so long as `-e` appears before *each* path. For example, you can install GitPython, gitdb, and smmap editably in the currently active virtual environment this way:\n   107\t\n   108\t```sh\n   109\tpip install -e \".[test]\" -e git/ext/gitdb -e git/ext/gitdb/gitdb/ext/smmap\n   110\t```\n   111\t\n   112\tThe submodules must have been cloned for that to work, but that will already be the case if you have run `./init-tests-after-clone.sh`. You can use `pip list` to check which packages are installed editably and which are installed normally.\n   113\t\n   114\tTo reiterate, this approach should only rarely be used. For most development it is preferable to allow the gitdb and smmap dependencices to be retrieved automatically from PyPI in their latest stable packaged versions.\n   115\t\n   116\t### Limitations\n   117\t\n   118\t#### Leakage of System Resources\n   119\t\n   120\tGitPython is not suited for long-running processes (like daemons) as it tends to\n   121\tleak system resources. It was written in a time where destructors (as implemented\n   122\tin the `__del__` method) still ran deterministically.\n   123\t\n   124\tIn case you still want to use it in such a context, you will want to search the\n   125\tcodebase for `__del__` implementations and call these yourself when you see fit.\n   126\t\n   127\tAnother way assure proper cleanup of resources is to factor out GitPython into a\n   128\tseparate process which can be dropped periodically.\n   129\t\n   130\t#### Windows support\n   131\t\n   132\tSee [Issue #525](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/525).\n   133\t\n   134\t### RUNNING TESTS\n   135\t\n   136\t_Important_: Right after cloning this repository, please be sure to have executed\n   137\tthe `./init-tests-after-clone.sh` script in the repository root.

Update/verify the **version** in the `VERSION` file.\n   216\t2. Update/verify that the `doc/source/changes.rst` changelog file was updated. It should include a link to the forthcoming release page: `https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/releases/tag/<version>`\n   217\t3. Commit everything.\n   218\t4. Run `git tag -s <version>` to tag the version in Git.\n   219\t5. _Optionally_ create and activate a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment). (Then the next step can install `build` and `twine`.)\n   220\t6. Run `make release`.\n   221\t7. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/releases) and publish a new one with the recently pushed tag. Generate the changelog.\n   222\t\n   223\t### Projects using GitPython\n   224\t\n   225\t- [PyDriller](https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller)\n   226\t- [Kivy Designer](https://github.com/kivy/kivy-designer)\n   227\t- [Prowl](https://github.com/nettitude/Prowl)\n   228\t- [Python Taint](https://github.com/python-security/pyt)\n   229\t- [Buster](https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster)\n   230\t- [git-ftp](https://github.com/ezyang/git-ftp)\n   231\t- [Git-Pandas](https://github.com/wdm0006/git-pandas)\n   232\t- [PyGitUp](https://github.com/msiemens/PyGitUp)\n   233\t- [PyJFuzz](https://github.com/mseclab/PyJFuzz)\n   234\t- [Loki](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Loki)\n   235\t- [Omniwallet](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omniwallet)\n   236\t- [GitViper](https://github.com/BeayemX/GitViper)\n   237\t- [Git Gud](https://github.com/bthayer2365/git-gud)\n   238\t\n   239\t### LICENSE\n   240\t\n   241\t[3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause/), also known as the New BSD License.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

It can differentiate through loops, branches,\n    24\trecursion, and closures, and it can take derivatives of derivatives of\n    25\tderivatives. It supports reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation)\n    26\tvia [`jax.grad`](#automatic-differentiation-with-grad) as well as forward-mode differentiation,\n    27\tand the two can be composed arbitrarily to any order.\n    28\t\n    29\tJAX uses [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla)\n    30\tto compile and scale your NumPy programs on TPUs, GPUs, and other hardware accelerators.\n    31\tYou can compile your own pure functions with [`jax.jit`](#compilation-with-jit).\n    32\tCompilation and automatic differentiation can be composed arbitrarily.\n    33\t\n    34\tDig a little deeper, and you'll see that JAX is really an extensible system for\n    35\t[composable function transformations](#transformations) at [scale](#scaling).\n    36\t\n    37\tThis is a research project, not an official Google product.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>","tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"execute_bash","description":"Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>","tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"execute_bash","description":"Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>","tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"execute_bash","description":"Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as\n    44\t    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n    45\t  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and\n    46\t    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional\n    47\t    objects\n    48\t  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can\n    49\t    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply\n    50\t    ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically\n    51\t    align the data for you in computations\n    52\t  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform\n    53\t    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating\n    54\t    and transforming data\n    55\t  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,\n    56\t    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures\n    57\t    into DataFrame objects\n    58\t  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy\n    59\t    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of\n    60\t    large data sets\n    61\t  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data\n    62\t    sets\n    63\t  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of\n    64\t    data sets\n    65\t  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple\n    66\t    labels per tick)\n    67\t  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]\n    68\t    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],\n    69\t    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]\n    70\t  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range\n    71\t    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,\n    72\t    date shifting and lagging\n    73\t\n    74\t\n    75\t   [missing-data]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html\n    76\t   [insertion-deletion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#column-selection-addition-deletion\n    77\t   [alignment]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html?highlight=alignment#intro-to-data-structures\n    78\t   [groupby]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#group-by-split-apply-combine\n    79\t   [conversion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe\n    80\t   [slicing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#slicing-ranges\n    81\t   [fancy-indexing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html#advanced\n    82\t   [subsetting]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing\n    83\t   [merging]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-or-named-series-joining-merging\n    84\t   [joining]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#joining-on-index\n    85\t   [reshape]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n    86\t   [pivot-table]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n    87\t   [mi]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#hierarchical-indexing-multiindex\n    88\t   [flat-files]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#csv-text-files\n    89\t   [excel]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#excel-files\n    90\t   [db]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#sql-queries\n    91\t   [hdfstore]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#hdf5-pytables\n    92\t   [timeseries]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#time-series-date-functionality\n    93\t\n    94\t## Where to get it\n    95\tThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:\n    96\thttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\n    97\t\n    98\tBinary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python\n    99\tPackage Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas) and on [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pandas).\n   100\t\n   101\t```sh\n   102\t# conda\n   103\tconda install -c conda-forge pandas\n   104\t```\n   105\t\n   106\t```sh\n   107\t# or PyPI\n   108\tpip install pandas\n   109\t```\n   110\t\n   111\tThe list of changes to pandas between each release can be found\n   112\t[here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/index.html).

For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished.
