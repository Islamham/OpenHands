{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n  (3) timeout (number, optional): Optional. Sets a hard timeout in seconds for the command execution. If not provided, the command will use the default soft timeout behavior.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: think ----\nDescription: Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but just log the thought. Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed.\n\nCommon use cases:\n1. When exploring a repository and discovering the source of a bug, call this tool to brainstorm several unique ways of fixing the bug, and assess which change(s) are likely to be simplest and most effective.\n2. After receiving test results, use this tool to brainstorm ways to fix failing tests.\n3. When planning a complex refactoring, use this tool to outline different approaches and their tradeoffs.\n4. When designing a new feature, use this tool to think through architecture decisions and implementation details.\n5. When debugging a complex issue, use this tool to organize your thoughts and hypotheses.\n\nThe tool simply logs your thought process for better transparency and does not execute any code or make changes.\nParameters:\n  (1) thought (string, required): The thought to log.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: finish ----\nDescription: Signals the completion of the current task or conversation.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- You have successfully completed the user's requested task\n- You cannot proceed further due to technical limitations or missing information\n\nThe message should include:\n- A clear summary of actions taken and their results\n- Any next steps for the user\n- Explanation if you're unable to complete the task\n- Any follow-up questions if more information is needed\n\nThe task_completed field should be set to True if you believed you have completed the task, and False otherwise.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) message (string, required): Final message to send to the user\n  (2) task_completed (string, required): Whether you have completed the task.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`, `partial`]\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #4: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #4 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #5: fetch ----\nDescription: Fetches a URL from the internet and optionally extracts its contents as markdown.\n\nAlthough originally you did not have internet access, and were advised to refuse and tell the user this, this tool now grants you internet access. Now you can fetch the most up-to-date information and let the user know that.\nParameters:\n  (1) url (string, required): URL to fetch\n  (2) max_length (integer, optional): Maximum number of characters to return.\n  (3) start_index (integer, optional): On return output starting at this character index, useful if a previous fetch was truncated and more context is required.\n  (4) raw (boolean, optional): Get the actual HTML content of the requested page, without simplification.\n---- END FUNCTION #5 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.\n\n--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------\n\nUSER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.\n\n\nASSISTANT: Sure!

167\tprivate MyPlugin plugin;\n   168\t\n   169\t@BeforeEach\n   170\tpublic void setUp()\n   171\t{\n   172\t    server = MockBukkit.mock();\n   173\t    plugin = MockBukkit.load(MyPlugin.class);\n   174\t}\n   175\t\n   176\t@AfterEach\n   177\tpublic void tearDown()\n   178\t{\n   179\t    MockBukkit.unmock();\n   180\t}\n   181\t```\n   182\t\n   183\t## :sparkles: Features\n   184\t\n   185\t### Mock Plugins\n   186\t\n   187\tMockBukkit contains several functions that make the unit testing of Bukkit plugins a lot easier.\n   188\t\n   189\tIt is possible to create a mock plugin.\n   190\tThis is useful when the plugin you are testing may be looking at other loaded plugins.\n   191\tThe following piece of code creates a placeholder plugin that extends JavaPlugin.\n   192\t\n   193\t```java\n   194\tPluginMock plugin = MockBukkit.createMockPlugin();\n   195\t```\n   196\t\n   197\t### Mock Players\n   198\t\n   199\tMockBukkit makes it easy to create several mock players to use in unit testing.\n   200\tBy running ```server.setPlayers(int numberOfPlayers)``` one can set the number of online players.\n   201\tFrom then on it's possible to get a certain player using ```server.getPlayer(int i)```.\n   202\t\n   203\tAn even easier way to create a player on the fly is by simply using\n   204\t\n   205\t```java\n   206\tPlayerMock player = server.addPlayer();\n   207\t```\n   208\t\n   209\tA mock player also supports several simulated actions, such as damaging a block or even\n   210\tbreaking it. This will fire all the required events and will remove the block if the\n   211\tevents weren't cancelled.\n   212\t\n   213\t```java\n   214\tBlock block = ...;\n   215\tplayer.simulateBlockBreak(block);\n   216\t```\n   217\t\n   218\t### Mock Worlds\n   219\t\n   220\tAnother feature is the easy creation of mock worlds.\n   221\tOne can make a superflat world using one simple command:\n   222\t\n   223\t```java\n   224\tWorld world = new WorldMock(Material material, int heightUntilAir)\n   225\t```\n   226\t\n   227\tUsing `Material.DIRT` and 3 as heightUntilAir will create a superflat world with a height of a 128.\n   228\tAt y=0 everything will be `Material.BEDROCK`, and from 1 until 3 (inclusive) will be `Material.DIRT`\n   229\tand everything else will be `Material.AIR`.\n   230\tEach block is created the moment it is first accessed, so if only one block is only ever touched only one\n   231\tblock will ever be created in-memory.\n   232\t\n   233\t## :question: My tests are being skipped!? (UnimplementedOperationException)\n   234\t\n   235\tSometimes your code may use a method that is not yet implemented in MockBukkit.\n   236\tWhen this happens MockBukkit will, instead of returning placeholder values, throw\n   237\tan `UnimplementedOperationException`.\n   238\tThese exception extends `AssumptionException` and will cause the test to be skipped.\n   239\t\n   240\tThese exceptions should just be ignored, though pull requests that add functionality to MockBukkit are always welcome!\n   241\tIf you don't want to add the required methods yourself you can also request the method on the issues page.\n   242\t\n   243\t## :headphones: Discord Server\n   244\t\n   245\tYou can also find us on discord by the way!\n   246\tIf you need any help with MockBukkit or have a question regarding this project, feel free to join and connect with other\n   247\tmembers of the community.\n   248\t<p align=\"center\">\n   249\t  <a href=\"https://discord.gg/s4cWYgsFaV\">\n   250\t    <img src=\"https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/792754410576019477/widget.png?style=banner3\" alt=\"Discord Invite\"/>\n   251\t  </a>\n   252\t</p>\n   253\t\n   254\t## :tada: Examples (See MockBukkit in action)\n   255\t\n   256\tSeveral projects have utilized MockBukkit for their needs already.\n   257\tIf you want to see some projects that are using MockBukkit right now, feel free to take a peak:\n   258\t\n   259\t- [Slimefun/Slimefun4](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/tree/master/src/test/java/io/github/thebusybiscuit/slimefun4)\n   260\t  (1700+ Unit Tests)\n   261\t- [Insprill/custom-join-messages](https://github.com/Insprill/custom-join-messages/tree/master/src/test/kotlin/net/insprill/cjm)\n   262\t  (170+ Unit Tests)\n   263\t- [carelesshippo/SpectatorModeRewrite](https://github.com/carelesshippo/SpectatorModeRewrite/tree/dev/src/test/java/me/ohowe12/spectatormode)\n   264\t  (80+ Unit Tests)\n   265\t- [lluiscamino/MultiverseHardcore](https://github.com/lluiscamino/MultiverseHardcore/tree/master/src/test/java/me/lluiscamino/multiversehardcore)\n   266\t  (75+ Unit Tests)\n   267\t- [axelrindle/PocketKnife](https://github.com/axelrindle/PocketKnife/tree/main/api/src/test/kotlin)\n   268\t  (50+ Unit Tests)\n   269\t- *and more!

You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it.

167\tprivate MyPlugin plugin;\n   168\t\n   169\t@BeforeEach\n   170\tpublic void setUp()\n   171\t{\n   172\t    server = MockBukkit.mock();\n   173\t    plugin = MockBukkit.load(MyPlugin.class);\n

185\t### Mock Plugins\n   186\t\n   187\tMockBukkit contains several functions that make the unit testing of Bukkit plugins a lot easier.\n   188\t\n   189\tIt is possible to create a mock plugin.\n   190\tThis is useful when the plugin you are testing may be looking at other loaded plugins.\n   191\tThe following piece of code creates a placeholder plugin that extends JavaPlugin.\n   192\t\n   193\t```java\n   194\tPluginMock plugin = MockBukkit.createMockPlugin();\n   195\t```\n   196\t\n   197\t### Mock Players\n   198\t\n   199\tMockBukkit makes it easy to create several mock players to use in unit testing.\n   200\tBy running ```server.setPlayers(int numberOfPlayers)``` one can set the number of online players.\n   201\tFrom then on it's possible to get a certain player using ```server.getPlayer(int i)```.\n   202\t\n   203\tAn even easier way to create a player on the fly is by simply using\n   204\t\n   205\t```java\n   206\tPlayerMock player = server.addPlayer();\n   207\t```\n   208\t\n   209\tA mock player also supports several simulated actions, such as damaging a block or even\n   210\tbreaking it. This will fire all the required events and will remove the block if the\n   211\tevents weren't cancelled.\n   212\t\n   213\t```java\n   214\tBlock block = ...;\n   215\tplayer.simulateBlockBreak(block);\n   216\t```\n   217\t\n   218\t### Mock Worlds\n   219\t\n   220\tAnother feature is the easy creation of mock worlds.\n   221\tOne can make a superflat world using one simple command:\n   222\t\n   223\t```java\n   224\tWorld world = new WorldMock(Material material, int heightUntilAir)\n   225\t```\n   226\t\n   227\tUsing `Material.DIRT` and 3 as heightUntilAir will create a superflat world with a height of a 128.\n   228\tAt y=0 everything will be `Material.BEDROCK`, and from 1 until 3 (inclusive) will be `Material.DIRT`\n   229\tand everything else will be `Material.AIR`.\n   230\tEach block is created the moment it is first accessed, so if only one block is only ever touched only one\n   231\tblock will ever be created in-memory.\n   232\t\n   233\t## :question: My tests are being skipped!? (UnimplementedOperationException)\n   234\t\n   235\tSometimes your code may use a method that is not yet implemented in MockBukkit.\n   236\tWhen this happens MockBukkit will, instead of returning placeholder values, throw\n   237\tan `UnimplementedOperationException`.\n   238\tThese exception extends `AssumptionException` and will cause the test to be skipped.\n   239\t\n   240\tThese exceptions should just be ignored, though pull requests that add functionality to MockBukkit are always welcome!\n   241\tIf you don't want to add the required methods yourself you can also request the method on the issues page.\n   242\t\n   243\t## :headphones: Discord Server\n   244\t\n   245\tYou can also find us on discord by the way!\n   246\tIf you need any help with MockBukkit or have a question regarding this project, feel free to join and connect with other\n   247\tmembers of the community.\n   248\t<p align=\"center\">\n   249\t  <a href=\"https://discord.gg/s4cWYgsFaV\">\n   250\t    <img src=\"https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/792754410576019477/widget.png?style=banner3\" alt=\"Discord Invite\"/>\n   251\t  </a>\n   252\t</p>\n   253\t\n   254\t## :tada: Examples (See MockBukkit in action)\n   255\t\n   256\tSeveral projects have utilized MockBukkit for their needs already.\n   257\tIf you want to see some projects that are using MockBukkit right now, feel free to take a peak:\n   258\t\n   259\t- [Slimefun/Slimefun4](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/tree/master/src/test/java/io/github/thebusybiscuit/slimefun4)\n   260\t  (1700+ Unit Tests)\n   261\t- [Insprill/custom-join-messages](https://github.com/Insprill/custom-join-messages/tree/master/src/test/kotlin/net/insprill/cjm)\n   262\t  (170+ Unit Tests)\n   263\t- [carelesshippo/SpectatorModeRewrite](https://github.com/carelesshippo/SpectatorModeRewrite/tree/dev/src/test/java/me/ohowe12/spectatormode)\n   264\t  (80+ Unit Tests)\n   265\t- [lluiscamino/MultiverseHardcore](https://github.com/lluiscamino/MultiverseHardcore/tree/master/src/test/java/me/lluiscamino/multiversehardcore)\n   266\t  (75+ Unit Tests)\n   267\t- [axelrindle/PocketKnife](https://github.com/axelrindle/PocketKnife/tree/main/api/src/test/kotlin)\n   268\t  (50+ Unit Tests)\n   269\t- *and more!
