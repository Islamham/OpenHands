{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n  (3) timeout (number, optional): Optional. Sets a hard timeout in seconds for the command execution. If not provided, the command will use the default soft timeout behavior.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: think ----\nDescription: Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but just log the thought. Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed.\n\nCommon use cases:\n1. When exploring a repository and discovering the source of a bug, call this tool to brainstorm several unique ways of fixing the bug, and assess which change(s) are likely to be simplest and most effective.\n2. After receiving test results, use this tool to brainstorm ways to fix failing tests.\n3. When planning a complex refactoring, use this tool to outline different approaches and their tradeoffs.\n4. When designing a new feature, use this tool to think through architecture decisions and implementation details.\n5. When debugging a complex issue, use this tool to organize your thoughts and hypotheses.\n\nThe tool simply logs your thought process for better transparency and does not execute any code or make changes.\nParameters:\n  (1) thought (string, required): The thought to log.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: finish ----\nDescription: Signals the completion of the current task or conversation.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- You have successfully completed the user's requested task\n- You cannot proceed further due to technical limitations or missing information\n\nThe message should include:\n- A clear summary of actions taken and their results\n- Any next steps for the user\n- Explanation if you're unable to complete the task\n- Any follow-up questions if more information is needed\n\nThe task_completed field should be set to True if you believed you have completed the task, and False otherwise.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) message (string, required): Final message to send to the user\n  (2) task_completed (string, required): Whether you have completed the task.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`, `partial`]\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #4: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #4 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #5: fetch ----\nDescription: Fetches a URL from the internet and optionally extracts its contents as markdown.\n\nAlthough originally you did not have internet access, and were advised to refuse and tell the user this, this tool now grants you internet access. Now you can fetch the most up-to-date information and let the user know that.\nParameters:\n  (1) url (string, required): URL to fetch\n  (2) max_length (integer, optional): Maximum number of characters to return.\n  (3) start_index (integer, optional): On return output starting at this character index, useful if a previous fetch was truncated and more context is required.\n  (4) raw (boolean, optional): Get the actual HTML content of the requested page, without simplification.\n---- END FUNCTION #5 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.\n\n--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------\n\nUSER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.\n\n\nASSISTANT: Sure!

Furthermore, the API was designed to be as non-intrusive as\n    49\tpossible and as a result, Byte Buddy does not leave any trace in the classes that were created by it. For this reason,\n    50\tthe generated classes can exist without requiring Byte Buddy on the class path. Because of this feature, Byte Buddy\u2019s\n    51\tmascot was chosen to be a ghost.\n    52\t\n    53\tByte Buddy is written in Java 5 but supports the generation of classes for any Java version. Byte Buddy is a\n    54\tlight-weight library and only depends on the visitor API of the Java byte code parser library\n    55\t[ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/) which does itself\n    56\t[not require any further dependencies](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm/5.0.4/asm-5.0.4.pom).\n    57\t\n    58\tAt first sight, runtime code generation can appear to be some sort of black magic that should be avoided and only few\n    59\tdevelopers write applications that explicitly generate code during their runtime. However, this picture changes when\n    60\tcreating libraries that need to interact with arbitrary code and types that are unknown at compile time. In this\n    61\tcontext, a library implementer must often choose between either requiring a user to implement library-proprietary\n    62\tinterfaces or to generate code at runtime when the user\u2019s types becomes first known to the library. Many known libraries\n    63\tsuch as for example *Spring* or *Hibernate* choose the latter approach which is popular among their users under the term\n    64\tof using [*Plain Old Java Objects*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object). As a result, code generation\n    65\thas become an ubiquitous concept in the Java space. Byte Buddy is an attempt to innovate the runtime creation of Java\n    66\ttypes in order to provide a better tool set to those relying on code generation.\n    67\t\n    68\t___\n    69\t\n    70\t<a href=\"https://bytebuddy.net\">\n    71\t<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphw/byte-buddy/gh-pages/images/dukeschoice.jpg\" alt=\"Duke's Choice award\" height=\"110px\" align=\"left\" />\n    72\t</a>\n    73\t\n    74\tIn October 2015, Byte Buddy was distinguished with a\n    75\t[*Duke's Choice award*](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/dukes-award-102815.html)\n    76\tby Oracle. The award appreciates Byte Buddy for its \"*tremendous amount of innovation in Java Technology*\". We feel very\n    77\thonored for having received this award and want to thank all users and everybody else who helped making Byte Buddy the\n    78\tsuccess it has become. We really appreciate it!\n    79\t\n    80\t___\n    81\t\n    82\tByte Buddy offers excellent performance at production quality. It is stable and in use by distinguished frameworks and\n    83\ttools such as [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/), [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/)\n    84\t, [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson), [Google's Bazel build system](https://bazel.build/)\n    85\tand [many others](https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/wiki/Projects-using-Byte-Buddy). Byte Buddy is also used by a\n    86\tlarge number of commercial products to great result. It is currently downloaded over 75 million times a year.\n    87\t\n    88\tHello World\n    89\t-----------\n    90\t\n    91\tSaying *Hello World* with Byte Buddy is as easy as it can get. Any creation of a Java class starts with an instance of\n    92\tthe `ByteBuddy` class which represents a configuration for creating new types:\n    93\t\n    94\t```java\n    95\tClass<?> dynamicType = new ByteBuddy()\n    96\t  .subclass(Object.class)\n    97\t  .method(ElementMatchers.named(\"toString\"))\n    98\t  .intercept(FixedValue.value(\"Hello World!\"))\n    99\t  .make()\n   100\t  .load(getClass().getClassLoader())\n   101\t  .getLoaded();\n   102\tassertThat(dynamicType.newInstance().toString(), is(\"Hello World!\"));\n   103\t```\n   104\t\n   105\tThe default `ByteBuddy` configuration which is used in the above example creates a Java class in the newest version of\n   106\tthe class file format that is understood by the processing Java virtual machine. As hopefully obvious from the example\n   107\tcode, the created type will extend the `Object` class and overrides its `toString` method which should return a fixed\n   108\tvalue of `Hello World!`. The method to be overridden is identified by a so-called `ElementMatcher`. In the above\n   109\texample, a predefined element matcher `named(String)` is used which identifies methods by their exact names. Byte Buddy\n   110\tcomes with numerous predefined and well-tested matchers which are collected in the `ElementMatchers`\n   111\tclass and which can be easily composed. The creation of custom matchers is however as simple as implementing the\n   112\t([functional](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/FunctionalInterface.html)) `ElementMatcher` interface.\n   113\t\n   114\tFor implementing the `toString` method, the `FixedValue` class defines a constant return value for the overridden\n   115\tmethod. Defining a constant value is only one example of many method interceptors that ship with Byte Buddy. By\n   116\timplementing the `Implementation` interface, a method could however even be defined by custom byte code.\n   117\t\n   118\tFinally, the described Java class is created and then loaded into the Java virtual machine. For this purpose, a target\n   119\tclass loader is required. Eventually, we can convince ourselves of the result by calling the `toString` method on an\n   120\tinstance of the created class and finding the return value to represent the constant value we expected.\n   121\t\n   122\tA more complex example\n   123\t----------------------\n   124\t\n   125\tOf course, a *Hello World example* is a too simple use case for evaluating the quality of a code generation library. In\n   126\treality, a user of such a library wants to perform more complex manipulations, for example by introducing hooks into the\n   127\texecution path of a Java program. Using Byte Buddy, doing so is however equally simple. The following example gives a\n   128\ttaste of how method calls can be intercepted.\n   129\t\n   130\tByte Buddy expresses dynamically defined method implementations by instances of the `Implementation` interface. In the\n   131\tprevious example, `FixedValue` that implements this interface was already demonstrated. By implementing this interface,\n   132\ta user of Byte Buddy can go to the length of defining custom byte code for a method. Normally, it is however easier to\n   133\tuse Byte Buddy's predefined implementations such as `MethodDelegation` which allows for implementing any method in plain\n   134\tJava. Using this implementation is straight forward as it operates by delegating the control flow to any POJO. As an\n   135\texample of such a POJO, Byte Buddy can for example redirect a call to the only method of the following class:\n   136\t\n   137\t```java\n   138\tpublic class GreetingInterceptor {\n   139\t  public Object greet(Object argument) {\n   140\t    return \"Hello from \" + argument;\n   141\t  }\n   142\t}\n   143\t```\n   144\t\n   145\tNote that the above `GreetingInterceptor` does not depend on any Byte Buddy type. This is good news because none of the\n   146\tclasses that Byte Buddy generates require Byte Buddy on the class path! Given the above `GreetingInterceptor`, we can\n   147\tuse Byte Buddy to implement the Java 8 `java.util.function.Function` interface and its abstract `apply` method:\n   148\t\n   149\t```java\n   150\tClass<? extends java.util.function.Function> dynamicType = new ByteBuddy()\n   151\t  .subclass(java.util.function.Function.class)\n   152\t  .method(ElementMatchers.named(\"apply\"))\n   153\t  .intercept(MethodDelegation.to(new GreetingInterceptor()))\n   154\t  .make()\n   155\t  .load(getClass().getClassLoader())\n   156\t  .getLoaded();\n   157\tassertThat((String) dynamicType.newInstance().apply(\"Byte Buddy\"), is(\"Hello from Byte Buddy\"));\n   158\t```\n   159\t\n   160\tExecuting the above code, Byte Buddy implements Java's `Function` interface and implements the `apply` method as a\n   161\tdelegation to an instance of the `GreetingInterceptor` POJO that we defined before. Now, every time that the\n   162\t`Function::apply` method is called, the control flow is dispatched to `GreetingInterceptor::greet` and the latter\n   163\tmethod's return value is returned from the interface's method.\n   164\t\n   165\tInterceptors can be defined to take with more generic inputs and outputs by annotating the interceptor's parameters.\n   166\tWhen Byte Buddy discovers an annotation, the library injects the dependency that the interceptor parameter requires. An\n   167\texample for a more general interceptor is the following class:\n   168\t\n   169\t```java\n   170\tpublic class GeneralInterceptor {\n   171\t  @RuntimeType\n   172\t  public Object intercept(@AllArguments Object[] allArguments,\n   173\t                          @Origin Method method) {\n   174\t    // intercept any method of any signature\n   175\t  }\n   176\t}\n   177\t```\n   178\t\n   179\tWith the above interceptor, any intercepted method could be matched and processed. For example, when matching\n   180\t`Function::apply`, the method's arguments would be passed as the single element of an array. Also, a `Method`\n   181\treference to `Fuction::apply` would be passed as the interceptor's second argument due to the `@Origin`\n   182\tannotation. By declaring the `@RuntimeType` annotation on the method, Byte Buddy finally casts the returned value to the\n   183\treturn value of the intercepted method if this is necessary. In doing so, Byte Buddy also applies automatic boxing and\n   184\tunboxing.\n   185\t\n   186\tBesides the annotations that were already mentioned there exist plenty of other predefined annotations. For example,\n   187\twhen using the `@SuperCall` annotation on a `Runnable` or `Callable` type, Byte Buddy injects proxy instances that allow\n   188\tfor an invocation of a non-abstract super method if such a method exists. And even if Byte Buddy does not cover a use\n   189\tcase, Byte Buddy offers an extension mechanism for defining custom annotations.\n   190\t\n   191\tYou might expect that using these annotations ties your code to Byte Buddy. However, Java ignores annotations in case\n   192\tthat they are not visible to a class loader. This way, generated code can still exist without Byte Buddy! You can find\n   193\tmore information on the `MethodDelegation` and on all of its predefined annotations in its *javadoc* and in Byte Buddy's\n   194\ttutorial.\n   195\t\n   196\tChanging existing classes\n   197\t----------------------\n   198\t\n   199\tByte Buddy is not limited to creating subclasses but is also capable of redefining existing code. To do so, Byte Buddy\n   200\toffers a convenient API for defining\n   201\tso-called [Java agents](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html). Java\n   202\tagents are plain old Java programs that can be used to alter the code of an existing Java application during its\n   203\truntime. As an example, we can use Byte Buddy to change methods to print their execution time. For this, we first define\n   204\tan interceptor similar to the interceptors in the previous examples:\n   205\t\n   206\t```java\n   207\tpublic class TimingInterceptor {\n   208\t  @RuntimeType\n   209\t  public static Object intercept(@Origin Method method, \n   210\t                                 @SuperCall Callable<?> callable) {\n   211\t    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();\n   212\t    try {\n   213\t      return callable.call();\n   214\t    } finally {\n   215\t      System.out.println(method + \" took \" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - start));\n   216\t    }\n   217\t  }\n   218\t}\n   219\t```\n   220\t\n   221\tUsing a Java agent, we can now apply this interceptor to all types that match an `ElementMatcher` for\n   222\ta `TypeDescription`. For the example, we choose to add the above interceptor to all types with a name that ends\n   223\tin `Timed`. This is done for the sake of simplicity whereas an annotation would probably be a more appropriate\n   224\talternative to mark such classes for a production agent. Using Byte Buddy's `AgentBuilder` API, creating a Java agent is\n   225\tas easy as defining the following agent class:\n   226\t\n   227\t```java\n   228\tpublic class TimerAgent {\n   229\t  public static void premain(String arguments, \n   230\t                             Instrumentation instrumentation) {\n   231\t    new AgentBuilder.Default()\n   232\t      .type(ElementMatchers.nameEndsWith(\"Timed\"))\n   233\t      .transform((builder, type, classLoader, module, protectionDomain) -> \n   234\t          builder.method(ElementMatchers.any())\n   235\t                 .intercept(MethodDelegation.to(TimingInterceptor.class))\n   236\t      ).installOn(instrumentation);\n   237\t  }\n   238\t}\n   239\t```\n   240\t\n   241\tSimilar to Java's `main` method, the `premain` method is the entry point to any Java agent from which we apply the\n   242\tredefinition. As one argument, a Java agent receives an instance of the `Instrumentation` interface which allows Byte\n   243\tBuddy to hook into the JVM's standard API for runtime class redefinition.\n   244\t\n   245\tThis program is packaged together with a manifest file with\n   246\tthe [`Premain-Class` attribute](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html)\n   247\tpointing to the `TimerAgent`. The resulting *jar* file can now be added to any Java application by\n   248\tsetting `-javaagent:timingagent.jar` similar to adding a jar to the class path. With the agent active, all classes\n   249\tending in `Timed` do now print their execution time to the console.\n   250\t\n   251\tByte Buddy is also capable of applying so-called runtime attachments by disabling class file format changes and using\n   252\tthe `Advice` instrumentation. Please refer to the *javadoc* of the `Advice` and the `AgentBuilder` class for further\n   253\tinformation. Byte Buddy also offers the explicit change of Java classes via a `ByteBuddy` instance or by using the Byte\n   254\tBuddy *Maven* and *Gradle* plugins.\n   255\t\n   256\tWhere to go from here?\n   257\t----------------------\n   258\t\n   259\tByte Buddy is a comprehensive library and we only scratched the surface of Byte Buddy's capabilities. However, Byte\n   260\tBuddy aims for being easy to use by providing a domain-specific language for creating classes. Most runtime code\n   261\tgeneration can be done by writing readable code and without any knowledge of Java's class file format.

Other than the code generation utilities\n    18\tthat [ship with the Java Class Library](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html), Byte\n    19\tBuddy allows the creation of arbitrary classes and is not limited to implementing interfaces for the creation of runtime\n    20\tproxies. Furthermore, Byte Buddy offers a convenient API for changing classes either manually, using a Java agent or\n    21\tduring a build.\n    22\t\n    23\tJava version compatibility\n    24\t==========================\n    25\t\n    26\tThe following table lists the minimal versions of Byte Buddy that is required need to support a certain Java \n    27\tclass file version without experimental support.

In contrast, Byte Buddy\u2019s API\n    47\taims for code that is concise and easy to understand for everybody. Nevertheless, Byte Buddy remains fully customizable\n    48\tdown to the possibility of defining custom byte code. Furthermore, the API was designed to be as non-intrusive as\n    49\tpossible and as a result, Byte Buddy does not leave any trace in the classes that were created by it. For this reason,\n    50\tthe generated classes can exist without requiring Byte Buddy on the class path. Because of this feature, Byte Buddy\u2019s\n    51\tmascot was chosen to be a ghost.\n    52\t\n    53\tByte Buddy is written in Java 5 but supports the generation of classes for any Java version. Byte Buddy is a\n    54\tlight-weight library and only depends on the visitor API of the Java byte code parser library\n    55\t[ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/) which does itself\n    56\t[not require any further dependencies](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm/5.0.4/asm-5.0.4.pom).\n    57\t\n    58\tAt first sight, runtime code generation can appear to be some sort of black magic that should be avoided and only few\n    59\tdevelopers write applications that explicitly generate code during their runtime. However, this picture changes when\n    60\tcreating libraries that need to interact with arbitrary code and types that are unknown at compile time. In this\n    61\tcontext, a library implementer must often choose between either requiring a user to implement library-proprietary\n    62\tinterfaces or to generate code at runtime when the user\u2019s types becomes first known to the library. Many known libraries\n    63\tsuch as for example *Spring* or *Hibernate* choose the latter approach which is popular among their users under the term\n    64\tof using [*Plain Old Java Objects*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object). As a result, code generation\n    65\thas become an ubiquitous concept in the Java space. Byte Buddy is an attempt to innovate the runtime creation of Java\n    66\ttypes in order to provide a better tool set to those relying on code generation.\n    67\t\n    68\t___\n    69\t\n    70\t<a href=\"https://bytebuddy.net\">\n    71\t<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphw/byte-buddy/gh-pages/images/dukeschoice.jpg\" alt=\"Duke's Choice award\" height=\"110px\" align=\"left\" />\n    72\t</a>\n    73\t\n    74\tIn October 2015, Byte Buddy was distinguished with a\n    75\t[*Duke's Choice award*](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/dukes-award-102815.html)\n    76\tby Oracle. The award appreciates Byte Buddy for its \"*tremendous amount of innovation in Java Technology*\". We feel very\n    77\thonored for having received this award and want to thank all users and everybody else who helped making Byte Buddy the\n    78\tsuccess it has become. We really appreciate it!\n    79\t\n    80\t___\n    81\t\n    82\tByte Buddy offers excellent performance at production quality. It is stable and in use by distinguished frameworks and\n    83\ttools such as [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/), [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/)\n    84\t, [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson), [Google's Bazel build system](https://bazel.build/)\n    85\tand [many others](https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/wiki/Projects-using-Byte-Buddy). Byte Buddy is also used by a\n    86\tlarge number of commercial products to great result. It is currently downloaded over 75 million times a year.\n    87\t\n    88\tHello World\n    89\t-----------\n    90\t\n    91\tSaying *Hello World* with Byte Buddy is as easy as it can get. Any creation of a Java class starts with an instance of\n    92\tthe `ByteBuddy` class which represents a configuration for creating new types:\n    93\t\n    94\t```java\n    95\tClass<?> dynamicType = new ByteBuddy()\n    96\t  .subclass(Object.class)\n    97\t  .method(ElementMatchers.named(\"toString\"))\n    98\t  .intercept(FixedValue.value(\"Hello World!\"))\n    99\t  .make()\n   100\t  .load(getClass().getClassLoader())\n   101\t  .getLoaded();\n   102\tassertThat(dynamicType.newInstance().toString(), is(\"Hello World!\"));\n   103\t```\n   104\t\n   105\tThe default `ByteBuddy` configuration which is used in the above example creates a Java class in the newest version of\n   106\tthe class file format that is understood by the processing Java virtual machine. As hopefully obvious from the example\n   107\tcode, the created type will extend the `Object` class and overrides its `toString` method which should return a fixed\n   108\tvalue of `Hello World!`. The method to be overridden is identified by a so-called `ElementMatcher`. In the above\n   109\texample, a predefined element matcher `named(String)` is used which identifies methods by their exact names. Byte Buddy\n   110\tcomes with numerous predefined and well-tested matchers which are collected in the `ElementMatchers`\n   111\tclass and which can be easily composed. The creation of custom matchers is however as simple as implementing the\n   112\t([functional](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/FunctionalInterface.html)) `ElementMatcher` interface.\n   113\t\n   114\tFor implementing the `toString` method, the `FixedValue` class defines a constant return value for the overridden\n   115\tmethod. Defining a constant value is only one example of many method interceptors that ship with Byte Buddy. By\n   116\timplementing the `Implementation` interface, a method could however even be defined by custom byte code.\n   117\t\n   118\tFinally, the described Java class is created and then loaded into the Java virtual machine. For this purpose, a target\n   119\tclass loader is required. Eventually, we can convince ourselves of the result by calling the `toString` method on an\n   120\tinstance of the created class and finding the return value to represent the constant value we expected.\n   121\t\n   122\tA more complex example\n   123\t----------------------\n   124\t\n   125\tOf course, a *Hello World example* is a too simple use case for evaluating the quality of a code generation library. In\n   126\treality, a user of such a library wants to perform more complex manipulations, for example by introducing hooks into the\n   127\texecution path of a Java program. Using Byte Buddy, doing so is however equally simple. The following example gives a\n   128\ttaste of how method calls can be intercepted.\n   129\t\n   130\tByte Buddy expresses dynamically defined method implementations by instances of the `Implementation` interface. In the\n   131\tprevious example, `FixedValue` that implements this interface was already demonstrated. By implementing this interface,\n   132\ta user of Byte Buddy can go to the length of defining custom byte code for a method. Normally, it is however easier to\n   133\tuse Byte Buddy's predefined implementations such as `MethodDelegation` which allows for implementing any method in plain\n   134\tJava. Using this implementation is straight forward as it operates by delegating the control flow to any POJO. As an\n   135\texample of such a POJO, Byte Buddy can for example redirect a call to the only method of the following class:\n   136\t\n   137\t```java\n   138\tpublic class GreetingInterceptor {\n   139\t  public Object greet(Object argument) {\n   140\t    return \"Hello from \" + argument;\n   141\t  }\n   142\t}\n   143\t```\n   144\t\n   145\tNote that the above `GreetingInterceptor` does not depend on any Byte Buddy type. This is good news because none of the\n   146\tclasses that Byte Buddy generates require Byte Buddy on the class path! Given the above `GreetingInterceptor`, we can\n   147\tuse Byte Buddy to implement the Java 8 `java.util.function.Function` interface and its abstract `apply` method:\n   148\t\n   149\t```java\n   150\tClass<? extends java.util.function.Function> dynamicType = new ByteBuddy()\n   151\t  .subclass(java.util.function.Function.class)\n   152\t  .method(ElementMatchers.named(\"apply\"))\n   153\t  .intercept(MethodDelegation.to(new GreetingInterceptor()))\n   154\t  .make()\n   155\t  .load(getClass().getClassLoader())\n   156\t  .getLoaded();\n   157\tassertThat((String) dynamicType.newInstance().apply(\"Byte Buddy\"), is(\"Hello from Byte Buddy\"));\n   158\t```\n   159\t\n   160\tExecuting the above code, Byte Buddy implements Java's `Function` interface and implements the `apply` method as a\n   161\tdelegation to an instance of the `GreetingInterceptor` POJO that we defined before. Now, every time that the\n   162\t`Function::apply` method is called, the control flow is dispatched to `GreetingInterceptor::greet` and the latter\n   163\tmethod's return value is returned from the interface's method.\n   164\t\n   165\tInterceptors can be defined to take with more generic inputs and outputs by annotating the interceptor's parameters.\n   166\tWhen Byte Buddy discovers an annotation, the library injects the dependency that the interceptor parameter requires. An\n   167\texample for a more general interceptor is the following class:\n   168\t\n   169\t```java\n   170\tpublic class GeneralInterceptor {\n   171\t  @RuntimeType\n   172\t  public Object intercept(@AllArguments Object[] allArguments,\n   173\t                          @Origin Method method) {\n   174\t    // intercept any method of any signature\n   175\t  }\n   176\t}\n   177\t```\n   178\t\n   179\tWith the above interceptor, any intercepted method could be matched and processed. For example, when matching\n   180\t`Function::apply`, the method's arguments would be passed as the single element of an array. Also, a `Method`\n   181\treference to `Fuction::apply` would be passed as the interceptor's second argument due to the `@Origin`\n   182\tannotation. By declaring the `@RuntimeType` annotation on the method, Byte Buddy finally casts the returned value to the\n   183\treturn value of the intercepted method if this is necessary. In doing so, Byte Buddy also applies automatic boxing and\n   184\tunboxing.\n   185\t\n   186\tBesides the annotations that were already mentioned there exist plenty of other predefined annotations. For example,\n   187\twhen using the `@SuperCall` annotation on a `Runnable` or `Callable` type, Byte Buddy injects proxy instances that allow\n   188\tfor an invocation of a non-abstract super method if such a method exists. And even if Byte Buddy does not cover a use\n   189\tcase, Byte Buddy offers an extension mechanism for defining custom annotations.\n   190\t\n   191\tYou might expect that using these annotations ties your code to Byte Buddy. However, Java ignores annotations in case\n   192\tthat they are not visible to a class loader. This way, generated code can still exist without Byte Buddy! You can find\n   193\tmore information on the `MethodDelegation` and on all of its predefined annotations in its *javadoc* and in Byte Buddy's\n   194\ttutorial.\n   195\t\n   196\tChanging existing classes\n   197\t----------------------\n   198\t\n   199\tByte Buddy is not limited to creating subclasses but is also capable of redefining existing code. To do so, Byte Buddy\n   200\toffers a convenient API for defining\n   201\tso-called [Java agents](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html). Java\n   202\tagents are plain old Java programs that can be used to alter the code of an existing Java application during its\n   203\truntime. As an example, we can use Byte Buddy to change methods to print their execution time. For this, we first define\n   204\tan interceptor similar to the interceptors in the previous examples:\n   205\t\n   206\t```java\n   207\tpublic class TimingInterceptor {\n   208\t  @RuntimeType\n   209\t  public static Object intercept(@Origin Method method, \n   210\t                                 @SuperCall Callable<?> callable) {\n   211\t    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();\n   212\t    try {\n   213\t      return callable.call();\n   214\t    } finally {\n   215\t      System.out.println(method + \" took \" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - start));\n   216\t    }\n   217\t  }\n   218\t}\n   219\t```\n   220\t\n   221\tUsing a Java agent, we can now apply this interceptor to all types that match an `ElementMatcher` for\n   222\ta `TypeDescription`. For the example, we choose to add the above interceptor to all types with a name that ends\n   223\tin `Timed`. This is done for the sake of simplicity whereas an annotation would probably be a more appropriate\n   224\talternative to mark such classes for a production agent. Using Byte Buddy's `AgentBuilder` API, creating a Java agent is\n   225\tas easy as defining the following agent class:\n   226\t\n   227\t```java\n   228\tpublic class TimerAgent {\n   229\t  public static void premain(String arguments, \n   230\t                             Instrumentation instrumentation) {\n   231\t    new AgentBuilder.Default()\n   232\t      .type(ElementMatchers.nameEndsWith(\"Timed\"))\n   233\t      .transform((builder, type, classLoader, module, protectionDomain) -> \n   234\t          builder.method(ElementMatchers.any())\n   235\t                 .intercept(MethodDelegation.to(TimingInterceptor.class))\n   236\t      ).installOn(instrumentation);\n   237\t  }\n   238\t}\n   239\t```\n   240\t\n   241\tSimilar to Java's `main` method, the `premain` method is the entry point to any Java agent from which we apply the\n   242\tredefinition. As one argument, a Java agent receives an instance of the `Instrumentation` interface which allows Byte\n   243\tBuddy to hook into the JVM's standard API for runtime class redefinition.\n   244\t\n   245\tThis program is packaged together with a manifest file with\n   246\tthe [`Premain-Class` attribute](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html)\n   247\tpointing to the `TimerAgent`. The resulting *jar* file can now be added to any Java application by\n   248\tsetting `-javaagent:timingagent.jar` similar to adding a jar to the class path. With the agent active, all classes\n   249\tending in `Timed` do now print their execution time to the console.\n   250\t\n   251\tByte Buddy is also capable of applying so-called runtime attachments by disabling class file format changes and using\n   252\tthe `Advice` instrumentation. Please refer to the *javadoc* of the `Advice` and the `AgentBuilder` class for further\n   253\tinformation. Byte Buddy also offers the explicit change of Java classes via a `ByteBuddy` instance or by using the Byte\n   254\tBuddy *Maven* and *Gradle* plugins.\n   255\t\n   256\tWhere to go from here?\n   257\t----------------------\n   258\t\n   259\tByte Buddy is a comprehensive library and we only scratched the surface of Byte Buddy's capabilities. However, Byte\n   260\tBuddy aims for being easy to use by providing a domain-specific language for creating classes. Most runtime code\n   261\tgeneration can be done by writing readable code and without any knowledge of Java's class file format.
