{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n  (3) timeout (number, optional): Optional. Sets a hard timeout in seconds for the command execution. If not provided, the command will use the default soft timeout behavior.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: think ----\nDescription: Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but just log the thought. Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed.\n\nCommon use cases:\n1. When exploring a repository and discovering the source of a bug, call this tool to brainstorm several unique ways of fixing the bug, and assess which change(s) are likely to be simplest and most effective.\n2. After receiving test results, use this tool to brainstorm ways to fix failing tests.\n3. When planning a complex refactoring, use this tool to outline different approaches and their tradeoffs.\n4. When designing a new feature, use this tool to think through architecture decisions and implementation details.\n5. When debugging a complex issue, use this tool to organize your thoughts and hypotheses.\n\nThe tool simply logs your thought process for better transparency and does not execute any code or make changes.\nParameters:\n  (1) thought (string, required): The thought to log.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: finish ----\nDescription: Signals the completion of the current task or conversation.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- You have successfully completed the user's requested task\n- You cannot proceed further due to technical limitations or missing information\n\nThe message should include:\n- A clear summary of actions taken and their results\n- Any next steps for the user\n- Explanation if you're unable to complete the task\n- Any follow-up questions if more information is needed\n\nThe task_completed field should be set to True if you believed you have completed the task, and False otherwise.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) message (string, required): Final message to send to the user\n  (2) task_completed (string, required): Whether you have completed the task.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`, `partial`]\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #4: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #4 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #5: fetch ----\nDescription: Fetches a URL from the internet and optionally extracts its contents as markdown.\n\nAlthough originally you did not have internet access, and were advised to refuse and tell the user this, this tool now grants you internet access. Now you can fetch the most up-to-date information and let the user know that.\nParameters:\n  (1) url (string, required): URL to fetch\n  (2) max_length (integer, optional): Maximum number of characters to return.\n  (3) start_index (integer, optional): On return output starting at this character index, useful if a previous fetch was truncated and more context is required.\n  (4) raw (boolean, optional): Get the actual HTML content of the requested page, without simplification.\n---- END FUNCTION #5 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.\n\n--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------\n\nUSER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.\n\n\nASSISTANT: Sure!

It records provenance information in archival metadata standards such as EAD or Dublin Core and **ensures integrity and availability** by frequently monitoring data and making sure that it has not been tampered with. All interactions between users and the repository (human and software) are logged for **security and accountability** reasons.\n    46\t\n    47\tTo experience RODA firsthand, please visit the **RODA demo site** at :link: [https://demo.roda-community.org](https://demo.roda-community.org).\n    48\t\n    49\t# :rocket: Features\n    50\t\n    51\t## Conforms to open standards\n    52\t\n    53\tRODA is compliant with several open descriptive metadata standards such as EAD, and Dublin Core, PREMIS for preservation metadata and METS for structural metadata.\n    54\t\n    55\tIt can support more standards by means of an advanced templating system that supports validation, indexing, viewing, and editing of descriptive metadata.\n    56\t\n    57\tSIP, AIP and DIP formats are also based on open specifications managed by the DILCIS Board to avoid technology lock-in (i.e., EARK Information Packages).\n    58\t\n    59\t## Vendor independent\n    60\t\n    61\tRODA is built on top of enduring open-source technologies. The entire infrastructure required to support RODA is also vendor independent. This means that you may use the hardware and the Linux distribution that best fit your institutional needs.\n    62\t\n    63\tBecause the product itself is open source, you don\u2019t have to rely on a single vendor for support. The entire source code of the system is available on GitHub for inspection.\n    64\t\n    65\t## Authenticity\n    66\t\n    67\tRODA uses PREMIS preservation metadata to create a trust chain between all generations of digital assets.\n    68\t\n    69\tPreservation metadata, together with the establishment of trust of its surrounding environment (ISO 16363 and ISO 14721) ensures that the repository service is reliable, and digital assets remain authentic over time.\n    70\t\n    71\tRODA also supports plugins that assess the validity of digital signatures and re-sign archived PDFs when the lifetime of digital signatures is coming to an end.\n    72\t\n    73\t## Support for multiple formats\n    74\t\n    75\tRODA can ingest all sorts of content independent of its format. Format migration plugins are available to cope with decaying formats such as text documents, raster images, relational databases, video, and audio.\n    76\t\n    77\tNormalization of file formats is possible by setting up adequate ingest workflows. Files are then preserved in formats more adequate for long-term archiving.\n    78\t\n    79\tRepresentation information networks can be managed within the repository itself, letting you opt for the right preservation strategy at the right time.\n    80\t\n    81\t## Advanced ingest workflows\n    82\t\n    83\tRODA supports the ingest of digital material as well as any associated metadata in several distinct formats.\n    84\t\n    85\tTools and libraries are provided to enable Producers to create packages in the supported Submission Information Package formats (SIP). Ingest workflows can be customised by the user to implement institutional policies and handle special collections of data. Ingest workflows can be enhanced via the use of open source or commercial plugins.\n    86\t\n    87\t## Embedded preservation actions\n    88\t\n    89\tPreservation actions can be executed right from the user interface over any selection of digital objects in the repository.\n    90\t\n    91\tThe task execution engine enables the repository to parallelise the task execution process to take full advantage of the existing CPUs.\n    92\t\n    93\tPreservation actions include format conversions, checksum verifications, virus checks, various, risk assessment, etc.\n    94\t\n    95\t## Scalable\n    96\t\n    97\tRODA is ideal for large organisations with millions of digital objects. It\u2019s service-oriented nature allows it to be highly scalable, enabling the distribution of load between several servers.\n    98\t\n    99\tThe use of horizontally scalable indexing services enables discovery services to be spread across multiple servers for greater performance.\n   100\t\n   101\tRODA also takes advantage of all the CPUs available in each server to mass process thousands of objects simultaneously for stellar performance.\n   102\t\n   103\t## Copes with the rapid changing nature of technology\n   104\t\n   105\tThe pluggable architecture of RODA makes it easy to add more functionality to the system without affecting its core functionality.\n   106\t\n   107\tThis includes adding new preservation capabilities such as format converters, risk assessment tools, and more.\n   108\t\n   109\tThe system stores data in a well-documented open AIP format that can be easily inspected by users and processed by third-party repository systems.\n   110\t\n   111\t## Retention and disposal policies\n   112\t\n   113\tRODA incorporates robust and comprehensive functionality for the definition and implementation of retention and disposal policies.\n   114\t\n   115\tThis feature empowers users to establish clear and concise guidelines for determining how long records need to be kept and how they should be disposed of, in accordance with national legislation or internal regulations.\n   116\t\n   117\tWith RODA's retention and disposal policies, organizations can confidently preserve their valuable digital assets for the long-term while mitigating risks associated with data privacy and security.\n   118\t\n   119\t## Integration with data production systems\n   120\t\n   121\tRODA exposes all its functionality via well-documented REST API. Convenient Java libraries are available on GitHub to allow developers interact with RODA via its Core APIs. Several tools exist to create and manipulate SIPs and submit them to RODA\u2019s for ingest.\n   122\t\n   123\tIn fact, RODA\u2019s ability to integrate data from other records management systems include: 1) packaging data available on a filesystem via RODA-in tool, 2) extract data from relational databases using DBPTK, and 3) custom integrations with original systems via APIs or using drop folders.\n   124\t\n   125\t[(Back to top)](#top)\n   126\t\n   127\t# :desktop_computer: Trying out RODA\n   128\t\n   129\t## Online demo\n   130\t\n   131\tTo experience RODA without having to install it on your local machine, please visit the RODA online demo available at :link: [https://demo.roda-community.org](https://demo.roda-community.org).\n   132\t\n   133\t## Testing environment\n   134\t\n   135\tTo install RODA on your local environment, please refer to our detailed installation guide, available at [Installation instructions](deploys/README.md).\n   136\t\n   137\tWe want to draw your attention the fact that these instructions are tailored for a single-node instance, specifically intended for testing purposes.

Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>", "role": "system"}, {"content": "\n        Build the project using the README.md in the repo. \n        Project Name: roda\n        Target OS: Linux4\n        Build Constraints: \n        1.

RODA is capable of ingesting, managing, and providing access to various types of digital content produced by large corporations and public bodies.\n    24\t\n    25\t<div align=\"center\" style=\"border: 1px solid rgba(50,50,50,.1); border-radius: 2px; padding: 5px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px\">\n    26\t    <a href=\"#rocket-features\">Features</a> &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;\n    27\t    <a href=\"#desktop_computer-trying-out-roda\">Trying out RODA</a> &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;\n    28\t    <a href=\"#books-documentation\">Documentation</a> &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;\n    29\t    <a href=\"#art-editions\">Editions</a> &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;\n    30\t    <a href=\"#shopping-marketplace\">Marketplace</a> &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;\n    31\t    <a href=\"#bellhop_bell-support\">Support</a> &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;\n    32\t    <a href=\"#writing_hand-contributing\">Contributing</a>\n    33\t</div>\n    34\t\n    35\t# :nerd_face: Overview\n    36\t\n    37\tRODA was developed using **open-source technologies** and it is supported by standards such as the Open Archival Information System (OAIS), Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS), Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Dublin Core (DC), [E-ARK Information Package specifications](https://dilcis.eu/) and PREMIS (Preservation Metadata).\n    38\t\n    39\tIt implements **multiple ingest workflows** that not only validate Submission Information Packages (SIP), but also checks their content for virus, handle file format identification, extract technical metadata, and migrate file formats to more \u201cpreservable\u201d alternatives.\n    40\t\n    41\tRODA enables users to access digital information in several forms, such as searching and browsing via an **online catalogue**, as well as providing **REST APIs** for systems integration. Discovery services are provided over both descriptive metadata and textual content (automatically extracted from an array of document-based formats). Online consultation of ingested objects, preservation formats and dissemination derivatives are also possible via the repository catalogue.\n    42\t\n    43\tAdministration interfaces allow repository managers to maintain **representation information** updated, **manage risks** and to execute **preservation actions** on all digital assets available in the repository.\n    44\t\n    45\tRODA ensures that **ingested data remains authentic** by recording PREMIS metadata for every action performed on a digital object. It records provenance information in archival metadata standards such as EAD or Dublin Core and **ensures integrity and availability** by frequently monitoring data and making sure that it has not been tampered with. All interactions between users and the repository (human and software) are logged for **security and accountability** reasons.\n    46\t\n    47\tTo experience RODA firsthand, please visit the **RODA demo site** at :link: [https://demo.roda-community.org](https://demo.roda-community.org).\n    48\t\n    49\t# :rocket: Features\n    50\t\n    51\t## Conforms to open standards\n    52\t\n    53\tRODA is compliant with several open descriptive metadata standards such as EAD, and Dublin Core, PREMIS for preservation metadata and METS for structural metadata.\n    54\t\n    55\tIt can support more standards by means of an advanced templating system that supports validation, indexing, viewing, and editing of descriptive metadata.\n    56\t\n    57\tSIP, AIP and DIP formats are also based on open specifications managed by the DILCIS Board to avoid technology lock-in (i.e., EARK Information Packages).\n    58\t\n    59\t## Vendor independent\n    60\t\n    61\tRODA is built on top of enduring open-source technologies. The entire infrastructure required to support RODA is also vendor independent. This means that you may use the hardware and the Linux distribution that best fit your institutional needs.\n    62\t\n    63\tBecause the product itself is open source, you don\u2019t have to rely on a single vendor for support. The entire source code of the system is available on GitHub for inspection.\n    64\t\n    65\t## Authenticity\n    66\t\n    67\tRODA uses PREMIS preservation metadata to create a trust chain between all generations of digital assets.\n    68\t\n    69\tPreservation metadata, together with the establishment of trust of its surrounding environment (ISO 16363 and ISO 14721) ensures that the repository service is reliable, and digital assets remain authentic over time.\n    70\t\n    71\tRODA also supports plugins that assess the validity of digital signatures and re-sign archived PDFs when the lifetime of digital signatures is coming to an end.\n    72\t\n    73\t## Support for multiple formats\n    74\t\n    75\tRODA can ingest all sorts of content independent of its format. Format migration plugins are available to cope with decaying formats such as text documents, raster images, relational databases, video, and audio.\n    76\t\n    77\tNormalization of file formats is possible by setting up adequate ingest workflows. Files are then preserved in formats more adequate for long-term archiving.\n    78\t\n    79\tRepresentation information networks can be managed within the repository itself, letting you opt for the right preservation strategy at the right time.\n    80\t\n    81\t## Advanced ingest workflows\n    82\t\n    83\tRODA supports the ingest of digital material as well as any associated metadata in several distinct formats.\n    84\t\n    85\tTools and libraries are provided to enable Producers to create packages in the supported Submission Information Package formats (SIP). Ingest workflows can be customised by the user to implement institutional policies and handle special collections of data. Ingest workflows can be enhanced via the use of open source or commercial plugins.\n    86\t\n    87\t## Embedded preservation actions\n    88\t\n    89\tPreservation actions can be executed right from the user interface over any selection of digital objects in the repository.\n    90\t\n    91\tThe task execution engine enables the repository to parallelise the task execution process to take full advantage of the existing CPUs.\n    92\t\n    93\tPreservation actions include format conversions, checksum verifications, virus checks, various, risk assessment, etc.\n    94\t\n    95\t## Scalable\n    96\t\n    97\tRODA is ideal for large organisations with millions of digital objects. It\u2019s service-oriented nature allows it to be highly scalable, enabling the distribution of load between several servers.\n    98\t\n    99\tThe use of horizontally scalable indexing services enables discovery services to be spread across multiple servers for greater performance.\n   100\t\n   101\tRODA also takes advantage of all the CPUs available in each server to mass process thousands of objects simultaneously for stellar performance.\n   102\t\n   103\t## Copes with the rapid changing nature of technology\n   104\t\n   105\tThe pluggable architecture of RODA makes it easy to add more functionality to the system without affecting its core functionality.\n   106\t\n   107\tThis includes adding new preservation capabilities such as format converters, risk assessment tools, and more.\n   108\t\n   109\tThe system stores data in a well-documented open AIP format that can be easily inspected by users and processed by third-party repository systems.\n   110\t\n   111\t## Retention and disposal policies\n   112\t\n   113\tRODA incorporates robust and comprehensive functionality for the definition and implementation of retention and disposal policies.\n   114\t\n   115\tThis feature empowers users to establish clear and concise guidelines for determining how long records need to be kept and how they should be disposed of, in accordance with national legislation or internal regulations.\n   116\t\n   117\tWith RODA's retention and disposal policies, organizations can confidently preserve their valuable digital assets for the long-term while mitigating risks associated with data privacy and security.\n   118\t\n   119\t## Integration with data production systems\n   120\t\n   121\tRODA exposes all its functionality via well-documented REST API. Convenient Java libraries are available on GitHub to allow developers interact with RODA via its Core APIs. Several tools exist to create and manipulate SIPs and submit them to RODA\u2019s for ingest.\n   122\t\n   123\tIn fact, RODA\u2019s ability to integrate data from other records management systems include: 1) packaging data available on a filesystem via RODA-in tool, 2) extract data from relational databases using DBPTK, and 3) custom integrations with original systems via APIs or using drop folders.\n   124\t\n   125\t[(Back to top)](#top)\n   126\t\n   127\t# :desktop_computer: Trying out RODA\n   128\t\n   129\t## Online demo\n   130\t\n   131\tTo experience RODA without having to install it on your local machine, please visit the RODA online demo available at :link: [https://demo.roda-community.org](https://demo.roda-community.org).\n   132\t\n   133\t## Testing environment\n   134\t\n   135\tTo install RODA on your local environment, please refer to our detailed installation guide, available at [Installation instructions](deploys/README.md).\n   136\t\n   137\tWe want to draw your attention the fact that these instructions are tailored for a single-node instance, specifically intended for testing purposes.
