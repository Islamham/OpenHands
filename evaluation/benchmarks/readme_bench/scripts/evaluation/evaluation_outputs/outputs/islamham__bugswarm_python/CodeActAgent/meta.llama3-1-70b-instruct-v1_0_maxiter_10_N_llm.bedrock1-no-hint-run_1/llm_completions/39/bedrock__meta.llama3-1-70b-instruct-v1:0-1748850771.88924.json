{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n  (3) timeout (number, optional): Optional. Sets a hard timeout in seconds for the command execution. If not provided, the command will use the default soft timeout behavior.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: think ----\nDescription: Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but just log the thought. Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed.\n\nCommon use cases:\n1. When exploring a repository and discovering the source of a bug, call this tool to brainstorm several unique ways of fixing the bug, and assess which change(s) are likely to be simplest and most effective.\n2. After receiving test results, use this tool to brainstorm ways to fix failing tests.\n3. When planning a complex refactoring, use this tool to outline different approaches and their tradeoffs.\n4. When designing a new feature, use this tool to think through architecture decisions and implementation details.\n5. When debugging a complex issue, use this tool to organize your thoughts and hypotheses.\n\nThe tool simply logs your thought process for better transparency and does not execute any code or make changes.\nParameters:\n  (1) thought (string, required): The thought to log.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: finish ----\nDescription: Signals the completion of the current task or conversation.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- You have successfully completed the user's requested task\n- You cannot proceed further due to technical limitations or missing information\n\nThe message should include:\n- A clear summary of actions taken and their results\n- Any next steps for the user\n- Explanation if you're unable to complete the task\n- Any follow-up questions if more information is needed\n\nThe task_completed field should be set to True if you believed you have completed the task, and False otherwise.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) message (string, required): Final message to send to the user\n  (2) task_completed (string, required): Whether you have completed the task.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`, `partial`]\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #4: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #4 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #5: fetch ----\nDescription: Fetches a URL from the internet and optionally extracts its contents as markdown.\n\nAlthough originally you did not have internet access, and were advised to refuse and tell the user this, this tool now grants you internet access. Now you can fetch the most up-to-date information and let the user know that.\nParameters:\n  (1) url (string, required): URL to fetch\n  (2) max_length (integer, optional): Maximum number of characters to return.\n  (3) start_index (integer, optional): On return output starting at this character index, useful if a previous fetch was truncated and more context is required.\n  (4) raw (boolean, optional): Get the actual HTML content of the requested page, without simplification.\n---- END FUNCTION #5 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.\n\n--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------\n\nUSER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.\n\n\nASSISTANT: Sure!

To obtain such a\n    70\twhitelist automatically, pass `--make-whitelist` to Vulture:\n    71\t\n    72\t    $ vulture mydir --make-whitelist > whitelist.py\n    73\t    $ vulture mydir whitelist.py\n    74\t\n    75\tNote that the resulting `whitelist.py` file will contain valid Python\n    76\tsyntax, but for Python to be able to *run* it, you will usually have to\n    77\tmake some modifications.\n    78\t\n    79\tWe collect whitelists for common Python modules and packages in\n    80\t`vulture/whitelists/` (pull requests are welcome).\n    81\t\n    82\t#### Ignoring files\n    83\t\n    84\tIf you want to ignore a whole file or directory, use the `--exclude` parameter\n    85\t(e.g., `--exclude \"*settings.py,*/docs/*.py,*/test_*.py,*/.venv/*.py\"`). The\n    86\texclude patterns are matched against absolute paths.\n    87\t\n    88\t#### Flake8 noqa comments\n    89\t\n    90\t<!-- Hide noqa docs until we decide whether we want to support it.\n    91\tAnother way of ignoring errors is to annotate the line causing the false\n    92\tpositive with `# noqa: <ERROR_CODE>` in a trailing comment (e.g., `#\n    93\tnoqa: V103`). The `ERROR_CODE` specifies what kind of dead code to\n    94\tignore (see the table below for the list of error codes). In case no\n    95\terror code is specified, Vulture ignores all results for the line.\n    96\t(Note that the line number for decorated objects is the line number of\n    97\tthe first decorator.)\n    98\t-->\n    99\t\n   100\tFor compatibility with [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/), Vulture\n   101\tsupports the [F401 and\n   102\tF841](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html) error\n   103\tcodes for ignoring unused imports (`# noqa: F401`) and unused local\n   104\tvariables (`# noqa: F841`). However, we recommend using whitelists instead\n   105\tof `noqa` comments, since `noqa` comments add visual noise to the code and\n   106\tmake it harder to read.\n   107\t\n   108\t#### Ignoring names\n   109\t\n   110\tYou can use `--ignore-names foo*,ba[rz]` to let Vulture ignore all names\n   111\tstarting with `foo` and the names `bar` and `baz`. Additionally, the\n   112\t`--ignore-decorators` option can be used to ignore the names of functions\n   113\tdecorated with the given decorator (but not their arguments or function body).\n   114\tThis is helpful for example in Flask\n   115\tprojects, where you can use `--ignore-decorators \"@app.route\"` to ignore all\n   116\tfunction names with the `@app.route` decorator. Note that Vulture simplifies\n   117\tdecorators it cannot parse: `@foo.bar(x, y)` becomes \"@foo.bar\" and\n   118\t`@foo.bar(x, y).baz` becomes \"@\" internally.\n   119\t\n   120\tWe recommend using whitelists instead of `--ignore-names` or\n   121\t`--ignore-decorators` whenever possible, since whitelists are\n   122\tautomatically checked for syntactic correctness when passed to Vulture\n   123\tand often you can even pass them to your Python interpreter and let it\n   124\tcheck that all whitelisted code actually still exists in your project.\n   125\t\n   126\t#### Marking unused variables\n   127\t\n   128\tThere are situations where you can't just remove unused variables, e.g.,\n   129\tin function signatures. The recommended solution is to use the `del`\n   130\tkeyword as described in the\n   131\t[PyLint manual](http://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/messages:w0613) and on\n   132\t[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14836005):\n   133\t\n   134\t```python\n   135\tdef foo(x, y):\n   136\t    del y\n   137\t    return x + 3\n   138\t```\n   139\t\n   140\tVulture will also ignore all variables that start with an underscore, so\n   141\tyou can use `_x, y = get_pos()` to mark unused tuple assignments or\n   142\tfunction arguments, e.g., `def foo(x, _y)`.\n   143\t\n   144\t#### Minimum confidence\n   145\t\n   146\tRaise the minimum [confidence value](#types-of-unused-code) with the `--min-confidence` flag.\n   147\t\n   148\t#### Unreachable code\n   149\t\n   150\tIf Vulture complains about code like `if False:`, you can use a Boolean\n   151\tflag `debug = False` and write `if debug:` instead. This makes the code\n   152\tmore readable and silences Vulture.\n   153\t\n   154\t#### Forward references for type annotations\n   155\t\n   156\tSee [#216](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture/issues/216). For\n   157\texample, instead of `def foo(arg: \"Sequence\"): ...`, we recommend using\n   158\t\n   159\t``` python\n   160\tfrom __future__ import annotations\n   161\t\n   162\tdef foo(arg: Sequence):\n   163\t    ...\n   164\t```\n   165\t\n   166\t\n   167\t## Configuration\n   168\t\n   169\tYou can also store command line arguments in `pyproject.toml` under the\n   170\t`tool.vulture` section. Simply remove leading dashes and replace all\n   171\tremaining dashes with underscores.\n   172\t\n   173\tOptions given on the command line have precedence over options in\n   174\t`pyproject.toml`.\n   175\t\n   176\tExample Config:\n   177\t\n   178\t``` toml\n   179\t[tool.vulture]\n   180\texclude = [\"*file*.py\", \"dir/\"]\n   181\tignore_decorators = [\"@app.route\", \"@require_*\"]\n   182\tignore_names = [\"visit_*\", \"do_*\"]\n   183\tmake_whitelist = true\n   184\tmin_confidence = 80\n   185\tpaths = [\"myscript.py\", \"mydir\", \"whitelist.py\"]\n   186\tsort_by_size = true\n   187\tverbose = true\n   188\t```\n   189\t\n   190\tVulture will automatically look for a `pyproject.toml` in the current working directory.\n   191\t\n   192\tTo use a `pyproject.toml` in another directory, you can use the `--config path/to/pyproject.toml` flag.\n   193\t\n   194\t## Integrations\n   195\t\n   196\tYou can use a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) hook to run\n   197\tVulture before each commit. For this, install pre-commit and add the\n   198\tfollowing to the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in your repository:\n   199\t\n   200\t```yaml\n   201\trepos:\n   202\t  - repo: https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture\n   203\t    rev: 'v2.3'  # or any later Vulture version\n   204\t    hooks:\n   205\t      - id: vulture\n   206\t```\n   207\t\n   208\tThen run `pre-commit install`. Finally, create a `pyproject.toml` file\n   209\tin your repository and specify all files that Vulture should check under\n   210\t`[tool.vulture] --> paths` (see above).\n   211\t\n   212\tThere's also a [GitHub Action for Vulture](https://github.com/gtkacz/vulture-action),\n   213\ta [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sebastienfi.dead-code-finder)\n   214\tand you can use Vulture programatically. For example:\n   215\t\n   216\t``` python\n   217\timport vulture\n   218\t\n   219\tv = vulture.Vulture()\n   220\tv.scavenge(['.'])\n   221\tunused_code = v.get_unused_code()  # returns a list of `Item` objects\n   222\t```\n   223\t\n   224\t## How does it work?\n   225\t\n   226\tVulture uses the `ast` module to build abstract syntax trees for all\n   227\tgiven files. While traversing all syntax trees it records the names of\n   228\tdefined and used objects. Afterwards, it reports the objects which have\n   229\tbeen defined, but not used. This analysis ignores scopes and only takes\n   230\tobject names into account.\n   231\t\n   232\tVulture also detects unreachable code by looking for code after\n   233\t`return`, `break`, `continue` and `raise` statements, and by searching\n   234\tfor unsatisfiable `if`- and `while`-conditions.\n   235\t\n   236\t## Sort by size\n   237\t\n   238\tWhen using the `--sort-by-size` option, Vulture sorts unused code by its\n   239\tnumber of lines. This helps developers prioritize where to look for dead\n   240\tcode first.\n   241\t\n   242\t## Examples\n   243\t\n   244\tConsider the following Python script (`dead_code.py`):\n   245\t\n   246\t``` python\n   247\timport os\n   248\t\n   249\tclass Greeter:\n   250\t    def greet(self):\n   251\t        print(\"Hi\")\n   252\t\n   253\tdef hello_world():\n   254\t    message = \"Hello, world!\"\n   255\t    greeter = Greeter()\n   256\t    func_name = \"greet\"\n   257\t    greet_func = getattr(greeter, func_name)\n   258\t    greet_func()\n   259\t\n   260\tif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n   261\t    hello_world()\n   262\t```\n   263\t\n   264\tCalling :\n   265\t\n   266\t    $ vulture dead_code.py\n   267\t\n   268\tresults in the following output:\n   269\t\n   270\t    dead_code.py:1: unused import 'os' (90% confidence)\n   271\t    dead_code.py:4: unused function 'greet' (60% confidence)\n   272\t    dead_code.py:8: unused variable 'message' (60% confidence)\n   273\t\n   274\tVulture correctly reports `os` and `message` as unused but it fails to\n   275\tdetect that `greet` is actually used. The recommended method to deal\n   276\twith false positives like this is to create a whitelist Python file.\n   277\t\n   278\t**Preparing whitelists**\n   279\t\n   280\tIn a whitelist we simulate the usage of variables, attributes, etc. For\n   281\tthe program above, a whitelist could look as follows:\n   282\t\n   283\t``` python\n   284\t# whitelist_dead_code.py\n   285\tfrom dead_code import Greeter\n   286\tGreeter.greet\n   287\t```\n   288\t\n   289\tAlternatively, you can pass `--make-whitelist` to Vulture and obtain an\n   290\tautomatically generated whitelist.\n   291\t\n   292\tPassing both the original program and the whitelist to Vulture\n   293\t\n   294\t    $ vulture dead_code.py whitelist_dead_code.py\n   295\t\n   296\tmakes Vulture ignore the `greet` method:\n   297\t\n   298\t    dead_code.py:1: unused import 'os' (90% confidence)\n   299\t    dead_code.py:8: unused variable 'message' (60% confidence)\n   300\t\n   301\t<!-- Hide noqa docs until we decide whether we want to support it.\n   302\t**Using \"# noqa\"**\n   303\t\n   304\t```python\n   305\timport os  # noqa\n   306\t\n   307\tclass Greeter:  # noqa: V102\n   308\t    def greet(self):  # noqa: V103\n   309\t        print(\"Hi\")\n   310\t```\n   311\t\n   312\t## Error codes\n   313\t\n   314\tFor compatibility with [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/), Vulture\n   315\tsupports the [F401 and\n   316\tF841](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html) error\n   317\tcodes.\n   318\t\n   319\t| Error codes |    Description    |\n   320\t| ----------- | ----------------- |\n   321\t| V101        | Unused attribute  |\n   322\t| V102        | Unused class      |\n   323\t| V103        | Unused function   |\n   324\t| V104, F401  | Unused import     |\n   325\t| V105        | Unused property   |\n   326\t| V106        | Unused method     |\n   327\t| V107, F841  | Unused variable   |\n   328\t| V201        | Unreachable code  |\n   329\t\n   330\t-->\n   331\t\n   332\t## Exit codes\n   333\t\n   334\t| Exit code |                          Description                          |\n   335\t| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n   336\t|     0     | No dead code found                                            |\n   337\t|     1     | Invalid input (file missing, syntax error, wrong encoding)    |\n   338\t|     2     | Invalid command line arguments                                |\n   339\t|     3     | Dead code found                                               |\n   340\t\n   341\t## Similar programs\n   342\t\n   343\t  - [pyflakes](https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/) finds unused imports\n   344\t    and unused local variables (in addition to many other programmatic\n   345\t    errors).\n   346\t  - [coverage](https://pypi.org/project/coverage/) finds unused code\n   347\t    more reliably than Vulture, but requires all branches of the code to\n   348\t    actually be run.\n   349\t  - [uncalled](https://pypi.org/project/uncalled/) finds dead code by\n   350\t    using the abstract syntax tree (like Vulture), regular expressions,\n   351\t    or both.\n   352\t  - [dead](https://pypi.org/project/dead/) finds dead code by using the\n   353\t    abstract syntax tree (like Vulture).\n   354\t\n   355\t## Participate\n   356\t\n   357\tPlease visit <https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture> to report any\n   358\tissues or to make pull requests.\n   359\t\n   360\t  - Contributing guide:\n   361\t    [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n   362\t  - Release notes:\n   363\t    [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)\n   364\t  - Roadmap:\n   365\t    [TODO.md](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture/blob/main/TODO.md)\n   366\t\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-30d7d486-67e3-4724-a180-2d421a6aa62c", "created": 1748850771, "model": "meta.llama3-1-70b-instruct-v1:0", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\nI see that the `README.md` file contains information about the Vulture project, including its features, installation, usage, and configuration.

This is useful for\n     9\tcleaning up and finding errors in large code bases. If you run Vulture\n    10\ton both your library and test suite you can find untested code.\n    11\t\n    12\tDue to Python's dynamic nature, static code analyzers like Vulture are\n    13\tlikely to miss some dead code. Also, code that is only called implicitly\n    14\tmay be reported as unused. Nonetheless, Vulture can be a very helpful\n    15\ttool for higher code quality.\n    16\t\n    17\t## Features\n    18\t\n    19\t* fast: uses static code analysis\n    20\t* tested: tests itself and has complete test coverage\n    21\t* complements pyflakes and has the same output syntax\n    22\t* sorts unused classes and functions by size with `--sort-by-size`\n    23\t\n    24\t## Installation\n    25\t\n    26\t    $ pip install vulture\n    27\t\n    28\t## Usage\n    29\t\n    30\t    $ vulture myscript.py  # or\n    31\t    $ python3 -m vulture myscript.py\n    32\t    $ vulture myscript.py mypackage/\n    33\t    $ vulture myscript.py --min-confidence 100  # Only report 100% dead code.\n    34\t\n    35\tThe provided arguments may be Python files or directories. For each\n    36\tdirectory Vulture analyzes all contained\n    37\t<span class=\"title-ref\">\\*.py</span> files.\n    38\t\n    39\tAfter you have found and deleted dead code, run Vulture again, because\n    40\tit may discover more dead code.\n    41\t\n    42\t## Types of unused code\n    43\t\n    44\tIn addition to finding unused functions, classes, etc., Vulture can detect\n    45\tunreachable code. Each chunk of dead code is assigned a *confidence value*\n    46\tbetween 60% and 100%, where a value of 100% signals that it is certain that the\n    47\tcode won't be executed. Values below 100% are *very rough* estimates (based on\n    48\tthe type of code chunk) for how likely it is that the code is unused.\n    49\t\n    50\t| Code type | Confidence value |\n    51\t| ------------------- | -- |\n    52\t| function/method/class argument, unreachable code | 100% |\n    53\t| import | 90% |\n    54\t| attribute, class, function, method, property, variable | 60% |\n    55\t\n    56\tYou can use the `--min-confidence` flag to set the minimum confidence\n    57\tfor code to be reported as unused. Use `--min-confidence 100` to only\n    58\treport code that is guaranteed to be unused within the analyzed files.\n    59\t\n    60\t## Handling false positives\n    61\t\n    62\tWhen Vulture incorrectly reports chunks of code as unused, you have\n    63\tseveral options for suppressing the false positives. If fixing your false\n    64\tpositives could benefit other users as well, please file an issue report.\n    65\t\n    66\t#### Whitelists\n    67\t\n    68\tThe recommended option is to add used code that is reported as unused to a\n    69\tPython module and add it to the list of scanned paths. To obtain such a\n    70\twhitelist automatically, pass `--make-whitelist` to Vulture:\n    71\t\n    72\t    $ vulture mydir --make-whitelist > whitelist.py\n    73\t    $ vulture mydir whitelist.py\n    74\t\n    75\tNote that the resulting `whitelist.py` file will contain valid Python\n    76\tsyntax, but for Python to be able to *run* it, you will usually have to\n    77\tmake some modifications.\n    78\t\n    79\tWe collect whitelists for common Python modules and packages in\n    80\t`vulture/whitelists/` (pull requests are welcome).\n    81\t\n    82\t#### Ignoring files\n    83\t\n    84\tIf you want to ignore a whole file or directory, use the `--exclude` parameter\n    85\t(e.g., `--exclude \"*settings.py,*/docs/*.py,*/test_*.py,*/.venv/*.py\"`). The\n    86\texclude patterns are matched against absolute paths.\n    87\t\n    88\t#### Flake8 noqa comments\n    89\t\n    90\t<!-- Hide noqa docs until we decide whether we want to support it.\n    91\tAnother way of ignoring errors is to annotate the line causing the false\n    92\tpositive with `# noqa: <ERROR_CODE>` in a trailing comment (e.g., `#\n    93\tnoqa: V103`). The `ERROR_CODE` specifies what kind of dead code to\n    94\tignore (see the table below for the list of error codes). In case no\n    95\terror code is specified, Vulture ignores all results for the line.\n    96\t(Note that the line number for decorated objects is the line number of\n    97\tthe first decorator.)\n    98\t-->\n    99\t\n   100\tFor compatibility with [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/), Vulture\n   101\tsupports the [F401 and\n   102\tF841](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html) error\n   103\tcodes for ignoring unused imports (`# noqa: F401`) and unused local\n   104\tvariables (`# noqa: F841`). However, we recommend using whitelists instead\n   105\tof `noqa` comments, since `noqa` comments add visual noise to the code and\n   106\tmake it harder to read.\n   107\t\n   108\t#### Ignoring names\n   109\t\n   110\tYou can use `--ignore-names foo*,ba[rz]` to let Vulture ignore all names\n   111\tstarting with `foo` and the names `bar` and `baz`. Additionally, the\n   112\t`--ignore-decorators` option can be used to ignore the names of functions\n   113\tdecorated with the given decorator (but not their arguments or function body).\n   114\tThis is helpful for example in Flask\n   115\tprojects, where you can use `--ignore-decorators \"@app.route\"` to ignore all\n   116\tfunction names with the `@app.route` decorator. Note that Vulture simplifies\n   117\tdecorators it cannot parse: `@foo.bar(x, y)` becomes \"@foo.bar\" and\n   118\t`@foo.bar(x, y).baz` becomes \"@\" internally.\n   119\t\n   120\tWe recommend using whitelists instead of `--ignore-names` or\n   121\t`--ignore-decorators` whenever possible, since whitelists are\n   122\tautomatically checked for syntactic correctness when passed to Vulture\n   123\tand often you can even pass them to your Python interpreter and let it\n   124\tcheck that all whitelisted code actually still exists in your project.\n   125\t\n   126\t#### Marking unused variables\n   127\t\n   128\tThere are situations where you can't just remove unused variables, e.g.,\n   129\tin function signatures. The recommended solution is to use the `del`\n   130\tkeyword as described in the\n   131\t[PyLint manual](http://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/messages:w0613) and on\n   132\t[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14836005):\n   133\t\n   134\t```python\n   135\tdef foo(x, y):\n   136\t    del y\n   137\t    return x + 3\n   138\t```\n   139\t\n   140\tVulture will also ignore all variables that start with an underscore, so\n   141\tyou can use `_x, y = get_pos()` to mark unused tuple assignments or\n   142\tfunction arguments, e.g., `def foo(x, _y)`.\n   143\t\n   144\t#### Minimum confidence\n   145\t\n   146\tRaise the minimum [confidence value](#types-of-unused-code) with the `--min-confidence` flag.\n   147\t\n   148\t#### Unreachable code\n   149\t\n   150\tIf Vulture complains about code like `if False:`, you can use a Boolean\n   151\tflag `debug = False` and write `if debug:` instead. This makes the code\n   152\tmore readable and silences Vulture.\n   153\t\n   154\t#### Forward references for type annotations\n   155\t\n   156\tSee [#216](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture/issues/216). For\n   157\texample, instead of `def foo(arg: \"Sequence\"): ...`, we recommend using\n   158\t\n   159\t``` python\n   160\tfrom __future__ import annotations\n   161\t\n   162\tdef foo(arg: Sequence):\n   163\t    ...\n   164\t```\n   165\t\n   166\t\n   167\t## Configuration\n   168\t\n   169\tYou can also store command line arguments in `pyproject.toml` under the\n   170\t`tool.vulture` section. Simply remove leading dashes and replace all\n   171\tremaining dashes with underscores.\n   172\t\n   173\tOptions given on the command line have precedence over options in\n   174\t`pyproject.toml`.\n   175\t\n   176\tExample Config:\n   177\t\n   178\t``` toml\n   179\t[tool.vulture]\n   180\texclude = [\"*file*.py\", \"dir/\"]\n   181\tignore_decorators = [\"@app.route\", \"@require_*\"]\n   182\tignore_names = [\"visit_*\", \"do_*\"]\n   183\tmake_whitelist = true\n   184\tmin_confidence = 80\n   185\tpaths = [\"myscript.py\", \"mydir\", \"whitelist.py\"]\n   186\tsort_by_size = true\n   187\tverbose = true\n   188\t```\n   189\t\n   190\tVulture will automatically look for a `pyproject.toml` in the current working directory.\n   191\t\n   192\tTo use a `pyproject.toml` in another directory, you can use the `--config path/to/pyproject.toml` flag.\n   193\t\n   194\t## Integrations\n   195\t\n   196\tYou can use a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) hook to run\n   197\tVulture before each commit. For this, install pre-commit and add the\n   198\tfollowing to the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in your repository:\n   199\t\n   200\t```yaml\n   201\trepos:\n   202\t  - repo: https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture\n   203\t    rev: 'v2.3'  # or any later Vulture version\n   204\t    hooks:\n   205\t      - id: vulture\n   206\t```\n   207\t\n   208\tThen run `pre-commit install`. Finally, create a `pyproject.toml` file\n   209\tin your repository and specify all files that Vulture should check under\n   210\t`[tool.vulture] --> paths` (see above).\n   211\t\n   212\tThere's also a [GitHub Action for Vulture](https://github.com/gtkacz/vulture-action),\n   213\ta [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sebastienfi.dead-code-finder)\n   214\tand you can use Vulture programatically. For example:\n   215\t\n   216\t``` python\n   217\timport vulture\n   218\t\n   219\tv = vulture.Vulture()\n   220\tv.scavenge(['.'])\n   221\tunused_code = v.get_unused_code()  # returns a list of `Item` objects\n   222\t```\n   223\t\n   224\t## How does it work?\n   225\t\n   226\tVulture uses the `ast` module to build abstract syntax trees for all\n   227\tgiven files. While traversing all syntax trees it records the names of\n   228\tdefined and used objects. Afterwards, it reports the objects which have\n   229\tbeen defined, but not used. This analysis ignores scopes and only takes\n   230\tobject names into account.\n   231\t\n   232\tVulture also detects unreachable code by looking for code after\n   233\t`return`, `break`, `continue` and `raise` statements, and by searching\n   234\tfor unsatisfiable `if`- and `while`-conditions.\n   235\t\n   236\t## Sort by size\n   237\t\n   238\tWhen using the `--sort-by-size` option, Vulture sorts unused code by its\n   239\tnumber of lines. This helps developers prioritize where to look for dead\n   240\tcode first.\n   241\t\n   242\t## Examples\n   243\t\n   244\tConsider the following Python script (`dead_code.py`):\n   245\t\n   246\t``` python\n   247\timport os\n   248\t\n   249\tclass Greeter:\n   250\t    def greet(self):\n   251\t        print(\"Hi\")\n   252\t\n   253\tdef hello_world():\n   254\t    message = \"Hello, world!\"\n   255\t    greeter = Greeter()\n   256\t    func_name = \"greet\"\n   257\t    greet_func = getattr(greeter, func_name)\n   258\t    greet_func()\n   259\t\n   260\tif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n   261\t    hello_world()\n   262\t```\n   263\t\n   264\tCalling :\n   265\t\n   266\t    $ vulture dead_code.py\n   267\t\n   268\tresults in the following output:\n   269\t\n   270\t    dead_code.py:1: unused import 'os' (90% confidence)\n   271\t    dead_code.py:4: unused function 'greet' (60% confidence)\n   272\t    dead_code.py:8: unused variable 'message' (60% confidence)\n   273\t\n   274\tVulture correctly reports `os` and `message` as unused but it fails to\n   275\tdetect that `greet` is actually used. The recommended method to deal\n   276\twith false positives like this is to create a whitelist Python file.\n   277\t\n   278\t**Preparing whitelists**\n   279\t\n   280\tIn a whitelist we simulate the usage of variables, attributes, etc. For\n   281\tthe program above, a whitelist could look as follows:\n   282\t\n   283\t``` python\n   284\t# whitelist_dead_code.py\n   285\tfrom dead_code import Greeter\n   286\tGreeter.greet\n   287\t```\n   288\t\n   289\tAlternatively, you can pass `--make-whitelist` to Vulture and obtain an\n   290\tautomatically generated whitelist.\n   291\t\n   292\tPassing both the original program and the whitelist to Vulture\n   293\t\n   294\t    $ vulture dead_code.py whitelist_dead_code.py\n   295\t\n   296\tmakes Vulture ignore the `greet` method:\n   297\t\n   298\t    dead_code.py:1: unused import 'os' (90% confidence)\n   299\t    dead_code.py:8: unused variable 'message' (60% confidence)\n   300\t\n   301\t<!-- Hide noqa docs until we decide whether we want to support it.\n   302\t**Using \"# noqa\"**\n   303\t\n   304\t```python\n   305\timport os  # noqa\n   306\t\n   307\tclass Greeter:  # noqa: V102\n   308\t    def greet(self):  # noqa: V103\n   309\t        print(\"Hi\")\n   310\t```\n   311\t\n   312\t## Error codes\n   313\t\n   314\tFor compatibility with [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/), Vulture\n   315\tsupports the [F401 and\n   316\tF841](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html) error\n   317\tcodes.\n   318\t\n   319\t| Error codes |    Description    |\n   320\t| ----------- | ----------------- |\n   321\t| V101        | Unused attribute  |\n   322\t| V102        | Unused class      |\n   323\t| V103        | Unused function   |\n   324\t| V104, F401  | Unused import     |\n   325\t| V105        | Unused property   |\n   326\t| V106        | Unused method     |\n   327\t| V107, F841  | Unused variable   |\n   328\t| V201        | Unreachable code  |\n   329\t\n   330\t-->\n   331\t\n   332\t## Exit codes\n   333\t\n   334\t| Exit code |                          Description                          |\n   335\t| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n   336\t|     0     | No dead code found                                            |\n   337\t|     1     | Invalid input (file missing, syntax error, wrong encoding)    |\n   338\t|     2     | Invalid command line arguments                                |\n   339\t|     3     | Dead code found                                               |\n   340\t\n   341\t## Similar programs\n   342\t\n   343\t  - [pyflakes](https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/) finds unused imports\n   344\t    and unused local variables (in addition to many other programmatic\n   345\t    errors).\n   346\t  - [coverage](https://pypi.org/project/coverage/) finds unused code\n   347\t    more reliably than Vulture, but requires all branches of the code to\n   348\t    actually be run.\n   349\t  - [uncalled](https://pypi.org/project/uncalled/) finds dead code by\n   350\t    using the abstract syntax tree (like Vulture), regular expressions,\n   351\t    or both.\n   352\t  - [dead](https://pypi.org/project/dead/) finds dead code by using the\n   353\t    abstract syntax tree (like Vulture).\n   354\t\n   355\t## Participate\n   356\t\n   357\tPlease visit <https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture> to report any\n   358\tissues or to make pull requests.\n   359\t\n   360\t  - Contributing guide:\n   361\t    [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n   362\t  - Release notes:\n   363\t    [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)\n   364\t  - Roadmap:\n   365\t    [TODO.md](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture/blob/main/TODO.md)\n   366\t\n", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_02", "name": "str_replace_editor"}], "fncall_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-30d7d486-67e3-4724-a180-2d421a6aa62c", "created": 1748850771, "model": "meta.llama3-1-70b-instruct-v1:0", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "I see that the `README.md` file contains information about the Vulture project, including its features, installation, usage, and configuration.
