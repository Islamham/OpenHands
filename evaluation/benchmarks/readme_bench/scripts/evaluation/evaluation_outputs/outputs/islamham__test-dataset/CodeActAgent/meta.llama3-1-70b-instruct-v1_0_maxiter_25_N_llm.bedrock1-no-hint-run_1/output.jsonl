If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations.

First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>","tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"execute_bash","description":"Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>","tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"execute_bash","description":"Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>","tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"execute_bash","description":"Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The bash command to execute.

Other libraries both inside and outside the\n    20\t[pydicom organization](https://github.com/pydicom) are based on *pydicom*\n    21\tand provide support for other aspects of DICOM, and for more\n    22\tspecific applications.\n    23\t\n    24\tExamples are [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom), which\n    25\tis a Python library for DICOM networking, and [deid](https://github.com/pydicom/deid),\n    26\twhich supports the anonymization of DICOM files.\n    27\t\n    28\t\n    29\t## Installation\n    30\t\n    31\tUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n    32\t```\n    33\tpip install pydicom\n    34\t```\n    35\tUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n    36\t```\n    37\tconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n    38\t```\n    39\t\n    40\tFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n    41\t\n    42\t\n    43\t## Documentation\n    44\t\n    45\tThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/guides/user/index.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n    46\t\n    47\t## *Pixel Data*\n    48\t\n    49\tCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\n    50\tbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n    51\t```python\n    52\t>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n    53\t>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n    54\t>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n    55\t>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n    56\t>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n    57\t<class 'bytes'>\n    58\t>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n    59\t32768\n    60\t>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\n    61\tb'\\xaf\\x00'\n    62\t\n    63\t```\n    64\t\n    65\tIf [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n    66\t\n    67\t```python\n    68\t>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n    69\t>>> arr.shape\n    70\t(128, 128)\n    71\t>>> arr\n    72\tarray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n    73\t       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n    74\t       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n    75\t       ...,\n    76\t       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n    77\t       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n    78\t       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n    79\t```\n    80\t### Decompressing *Pixel Data*\n    81\t#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\n    82\tConverting JPEG, JPEG-LS or JPEG 2000 compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/guides/user/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n    83\t\n    84\t#### RLE\n    85\tDecompressing RLE *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, however it can be quite slow. You may want to consider [installing one or more additional Python libraries](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/guides/user/image_data_compression.html) to speed up the process.\n    86\t\n    87\t### Compressing *Pixel Data*\n    88\tInformation on compressing *Pixel Data* using one of the below formats can be found in the corresponding [encoding guides](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/guides/encoding/index.html). These guides cover the specific requirements for each encoding method and we recommend you be familiar with them when performing image compression.\n    89\t\n    90\t#### JPEG-LS, JPEG 2000\n    91\tCompressing image data from an ``ndarray`` or ``bytes`` object to JPEG-LS or JPEG 2000 requires installing the following:\n    92\t\n    93\t* JPEG-LS requires [pyjpegls](https://github.com/pydicom/pyjpegls)\n    94\t* JPEG 2000 requires [pylibjpeg](https://github.com/pydicom/pylibjpeg) and the [pylibjpeg-openjpeg](https://github.com/pydicom/pylibjpeg-openjpeg) plugin\n    95\t\n    96\t#### RLE\n    97\tCompressing using RLE requires no additional packages but can be quite slow. It can be sped up by installing [pylibjpeg](https://github.com/pydicom/pylibjpeg) with the [pylibjpeg-rle](https://github.com/pydicom/pylibjpeg-rle) plugin, or [gdcm](https://github.com/tfmoraes/python-gdcm).\n    98\t\n    99\t\n   100\t## Examples\n   101\tMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n   102\t\n   103\t**Change a patient's ID**\n   104\t```python\n   105\tfrom pydicom import dcmread\n   106\t\n   107\tds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n   108\t# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\n   109\tds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\n   110\tds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n   111\t```\n   112\t\n   113\t**Display the Pixel Data**\n   114\t\n   115\tWith [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n   116\t```python\n   117\timport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   118\tfrom pydicom import dcmread, examples\n   119\t\n   120\t# The path to the example \"ct\" dataset included with pydicom\n   121\tpath: \"pathlib.Path\" = examples.get_path(\"ct\")\n   122\tds = dcmread(path)\n   123\t# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\n   124\tarr = ds.pixel_array\n   125\t\n   126\tplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\n   127\tplt.show()\n   128\t```\n   129\t\n   130\t## Contributing\n   131\t\n   132\tWe are all volunteers working on *pydicom* in our free time.
